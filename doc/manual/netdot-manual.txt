# Introduction

[Netdot](http://netdot.uoregon.edu) is an open source tool designed to
help network administrators collect, organize and maintain network
documentation.

Netdot is actively developed by the [Network and Telecommunication
Services](http://ns.uoregon.edu) group of the [University of
Oregon](http://www.uoregon.edu).

Netdot features include:

*   Device discovery via SNMP

*   Layer 2 topology discovery and graphing, using multiple sources of
    information: CDP+LLDP, Spanning Tree Protocol, switch forwarding
    tables, router point-to-point subnets.

*   IPv4 and IPv6 address space management (also referred to as IPAM),
    including hierarchical organization, address block visualization and
    IP and MAC address location and tracking.

*   Cable plant information including: sites, rooms, jacks, closets,
    inter and intra-building wiring, circuits, etc.

*   Contact information for related entities: departments, providers,
    vendors, etc.

*   Netdot can generate configuration files for various other tools,
    including:

    * [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org),
    * [Sysmon](http://www.sysmon.org),
    * [RANCID](http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid),
    * [Cacti](http://www.cacti.net).
    * [ISC BIND and ISC DHCPD](http://www.isc.org)
    * [Smokeping](http://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/)

*   Netdot implements role-based access control, allowing tasks
    such as IP address management, documentation of switch/router ports
    and updating of contact information to be delegated to specific
    groups with limited access to the web interface.

## Structure

Netdot consists of several components:

1.  The database

    Our goal has been to make Netdot database-agnostic as much as
    possible. In principle, it should be able to use any database
    supported by Perl DBI. There are, however, some limitations to this,
    for example, schema migration scripts are db-specific and may not
    always be available. Currently MySQL is fully supported. There is
    currently partial support for PostgreSQL.

2.  The libraries

    The back-end code is a hierarchy of object-oriented Perl classes. It
    can function as an API as well. One advantage of this model is that
    presentation, collection and database can be separated among
    different physical machines.

3.  User Interface (UI)

    The web user interface is built on a templating system called
    HTML::Mason.

4.  Command Line scripts (CLI)

    Certain tasks, like device discovery, can be executed from the
    command line. Therefore, these tasks can be automated by running
    them periodically via CRON.

# Installation

## Obtaining the code

Clone the latest version of the Netdot repository from Github.com. You will need the git utility:

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/cvicente/Netdot.git
cd Netdot/
~~~~


## Requirements

*   Perl 5.6.1 or later

*   Apache2 with `mod_perl2`

*   MySQL or PostgreSQL

*   Authentication Server (optional). Netdot supports local
    authentication, as well as RADIUS, LDAP and Kerberos.

*   The RRDtool package, including its Perl modules, available at:
    <http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/>

*   The GraphViz package, available at:
    <http://www.graphviz.org/>

*   The latest Netdisco MIBs.
    <http://sourceforge.net/projects/netdisco/files/netdisco-mibs/>

*   Various Perl modules.

*   The 'make' utility.

### Installing dependencies

    There are two ways to install dependencies: The first and
    the recommended way is through package managers of your
    distribution (this will also install other necessary packages,
    not just Perl modules).

*   For systems with APT (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, etc.), run:

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~# apt-get install build-essential
    ~~~~

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~# make apt-install
    ~~~~

*   For systems with RPM (e.g. Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS), run:

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~# yum install make
    ~~~~

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~# make rpm-install
    ~~~~

> **Tip**
If you are still missing Perl modules after running this step,
you can complete the process in the next step.

*   If your package manager is not supported, or if you are missing
    dependencies, you can install those by hand. However, you can at least
    take advantage of the CPAN to install Perl modules automatically.

    To test for missing modules in your system, run:

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~% make testdeps
    ~~~~

    Then, use this to install the missing modules:

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~# make installdeps
    ~~~~

    If you need to install modules individually, you can do this
    instead:

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~# cpan
    >install Module::Blah
    ~~~~

## Configuration

Netdot comes with a configuration file that you need to customize to
your needs. You need to create a copy of `Default.conf` with the
name `Site.conf`

~~~~ {.bash}
~% cp etc/Default.conf etc/Site.conf
~~~~

Then, modify `Site.conf` to reflect your specific options. The original
file contains descriptions of each configuration item.

**Netdot will first read Default.conf and then Site.conf**

The reason for keeping two files is that when an upgrade is performed,
the `Default.conf` file can be re-written (to add new variables, etc.),
without overwriting your site-specific configuration.

> **Tip**
Notice that, each time you modify Site.conf, you must restart Apache for
the changes to take effect in the web interface.

## Upgrading

Look for a file called doc/UPGRADE for upgrade notes in a particular
distribution.

You should check if the version you are installing has any new
requirements that need to be satisfied:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# make testdeps
~# make installdeps (or rpm-install, apt-install)
~~~~

Netdot's database schema **usually** only changes between major
versions. For example, if upgrading from 0.8.x to 0.9.x, you will need
to run an upgrade script to adapt your current database to the new
schema.

If you are supposed to upgrade, this can be accomplished by running this
command:

(make a backup of your database first!)

~~~~ {.bash}
~# make upgrade
~~~~

Finally, install the new Netdot code and restart Apache:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# make install
~# /etc/init.d/httpd restart
~~~~

## Installing the package for the first time

*   Prepare your database administrator (DBA) account

    MySQL users: The DBA account for MySQL is usually created when installing
    the package. Make sure to set a password during the installation.

    Pg users: PostgreSQL normally comes with a default DBA account named 'postgres'.
    After installing, you may need to set the password for this account as follows:

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~% sudo -u postgres psql postgres
    ~~~~

    Set a password for the "postgres" database role using the command:

    ~~~~
    \password postgres
    ~~~~

    and give your password when prompted. Type Control+D to exit the prompt.

*   Adjust your database configuration if necessary

    MySQL users: If you intend to use the IPAM functionalities in Netdot, you might
    need to increase the maximum packet buffer size in my.conf to something like:

    ~~~~
    max_allowed_packet = 16M
    ~~~~

*   Make sure you have created the file etc/Site.conf with your
    configurations (See above).

*   You will then be ready to initialize the database.

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~% make installdb [parameters]
    ~~~~

    Remember you need to set `DB_DBA` and `DB_DBA_PASSWORD` to your
    database's admin username/password in etc/Site.conf before running
    this command. Or if you prefer, you can specify the `DB_DBA` and
    `DB_DBA_PASSWORD` values as parameters (however, these are used by
    many functions in Netdot, they will need to be set to the correct
    value in etc/Site.conf eventually)

    ~~~~
    DB_DBA=DATABASE-ADMIN-ACCOUNT
    DB_DBA_PASSWORD=DATABASE-ADMIN-PASSWORD
    ~~~~

*   From the top directory in the package, do:

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~# make install [parameters]
    ~~~~

    Possible parameters include:

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    PREFIX=YOUR-PREFIX (default: /usr/local/netdot)
    APACHEUSER=USER-YOUR-APACHE-RUNS-AS (default: apache)
    APACHEGROUP=GROUP-YOUR-APACHE-RUNS-AS (default: apache)
    ~~~~

    > **Tip**
    Debian or Ubuntu users: will probably need to set the APACHEUSER and
    APACHEGROUP variables to "www-data", which is the user that Apache
    runs as.


## Apache Configuration

Edit the supplied Apache config template for either Local, RADIUS, Kerberos or
LDAP authentication, copy it to your Apache config directory and include
it somewhere in your Apache configuration file (httpd.conf) (e.g.):

~~~~ {.apache}
Include conf/netdot_apache2_<local|radius|ldap|krb5>.conf
~~~~

Alternatively, some Apache environments provide a directory from which
files are included automatically when Apache starts. In that case, you
can create a link to the file in said directory.

For example, in Debian or Ubuntu, it's a two-step process:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# cd /etc/apache2
~# ln -s /usr/local/netdot/etc/netdot_apache24_local.conf sites-available/netdot.conf
~# a2ensite netdot
~~~~

Or, in other distributions with just one directory:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# ln -s /usr/local/netdot/etc/netdot_apache24_local.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/netdot.conf
~~~~

> **Tip**
Make sure you use the version of the file that gets copied into your
install directory by make install, not from the source directory. This
file contains relevant path substitutions based on your chosen install
prefix.

Once this is done, you can restart Apache2. If you used the default
settings, point your browser to:

~~~~
http://servername.mydomain/netdot/
~~~~

You should be able to log in with:

~~~~
username: "admin"
password: "admin"
~~~~

>**Tip**
If you are using the one of the external authentication options, you should
have Netdot(radius|ldap|krb5)FailToLocal set to "yes" in your `netdot_apache2_x.conf` 
file.

>**Warning**
Please remember to change the "admin" password! Go to `Contacts ->
People`, search for 'Admin', click on [edit] and type in a new password.
Then click on the Update button.

## CRON jobs

Netdot comes with a few scripts that should be run periodically as cron
jobs.

*   Retrieval of forwarding tables and ARP caches for IP/MAC address
    tracking

*   Devices should be re-discovered via SNMP frequently to maintain an
    accurate list of ports, ip addresses, etc.

*   Rediscovery of network topology

*   With time, old data like forwarding and ARP table entries, audit records,
	etc. should be deleted from the database to save disk space.

*   Netdot can generate text documentation that is easy to find using
    simple grepping commands, for example, information about people,
    locations, device port assignments, etc. This documentation should
    be kept up to date by exporting it frequently.

*   Configurations for external programs can be generated using Netdot
    data. See details later in this document.

*   The netdot.cron file included in the package is a sample crontab
    containing recommended periodic jobs. You should customize it to
    your liking and copy it to your cron directory, for example:

    ~~~~ {.bash}
    ~# cp etc/netdot.cron /etc/cron.d/netdot
    ~~~~

# Operation

## Device Management

In Netdot, devices are network infrastructure equipment: switches,
routers, firewalls, access points, servers, etc. End nodes such as
desktop computers, laptops and printers are not devices.

Netdot can discover and maintain an extensive amount of information
about network devices. The easiest way to gather and store this
information is by querying the devices using the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP). Devices can be discovered individually, by
subnet, or by providing a text file with a list of device addresses.

### Device Discovery using the web UI

Go to `Management -> Devices`. In the Tasks section, click on [new] and
type the hostname or IP address of the device in question, along with
the SNMP community and click [discover]. Netdot will then query the
device using SNMP and present a window where you can assign an owner
entity (for example, your organization), the entity that uses the device
(for example, your customer), the location and a contact list.

If you are discovering a layer 3 device with IP forwarding turned on
(such as a router or firewall), Netdot will ask you if you would like to
automatically create subnets, based on the IP configuration of the
device interfaces. This is a convenient way to add all your subnets into
Netdot.

Another option is to specify whether Netdot should assign any newly
created subnets the same owner and user entities assigned to the device.

Once you click on the [update] button, Netdot will show the discovery
information and a link to the device page at the bottom.

You can always re-discover a device manually by using the [snmp-update]
button on the top right corner of the device page. For example, if you
have added a new port adapter, new interface cards, or if the device has
been replaced with a different unit.

### Device discovery using the command line interface (CLI)

For brevity, let's assume you are located at the Netdot installation
prefix, for example, /usr/local/netdot.

You can discover a single device by executing:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/updatedevices.pl -H <device-name> -I -c <community>
~~~~

You can also try discovering a whole subnet like this:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/updatedevices.pl -B 192.168.1.0/24 -I -c <community>
~~~~

In addition, you can give Netdot a specific list of devices you would
like to discover:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/updatedevices.pl -E <text-file> -I
~~~~

The file should contain a list of device names or IP addresses,
one per line, for example:

~~~~
device1
device2
device3
...
~~~~

Optionally, each device line can be accompanied by its SNMP community:

~~~~
device1 community1
device2 community1
device3 community2
...
~~~~

Netdot can retrieve ARP and bridge forwarding tables. You will
probably want to fetch ARP caches from your layer 3 devices (i.e.
routers and firewalls), and forwarding tables from your layer 2 devices
(switches). Examples:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/updatedevices.pl -H <router> -A -c <community>
~~~~

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/updatedevices.pl -H <switch> -F -c <community>
~~~~

Netdot can also try to discover the network topology. For that, you need
to run:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/updatedevices.pl -T
~~~~

If the configuration option `ADD_UNKNOWN_DP_DEVS` is set to 1 (true),
then Netdot will attempt to discover any devices seen (via CDP/LLDP) on
existing device interfaces. With the previous command, Netdot will only
try to discover directly connected devices. In order to attempt to
discover all unknown neighbors, and the neighbors of those neighbors,
use the following parameter:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/updatedevices.pl -T --recursive
~~~~

Ideally, once you have discovered all your devices, you should combine
all this functionality and have it run periodically (e.g. every hour)
via CRON. A sample crontab entry would be:

~~~~
0 * * * * root /usr/local/netdot/bin/updatedevices.pl -DIFAT
~~~~

If you want to only update a subset of the devices in your database,
you may use the "--matching" parameter to specify a regular expression,
which will be applied against devices' fully qualified names. For example
if all your routers have the suffix "-gw", you could do something like:

~~~~
0 * * * * root /usr/local/netdot/bin/updatedevices.pl -DIFAT --matching "-gw"
~~~~

You will find some examples of cron jobs in the file named netdot.cron

### Device Documentation

Once you have created a device, you can go ahead and add more
information about it.

Going to `Management -> Devices` you can search for a device by name, IP
or MAC address.

From the device page, you can navigate to the different sub-sections
depending on the information you want to edit. Notice that clicking on
any field name will open a browser window with a description of that field.

#### Basics Tab: In this section you can view and edit general information
about the device, including its location, contact information, and
management details.

#### Interfaces Tab: Here you can edit interface descriptions, assign
network jacks, etc. by clicking on the [edit] button. You can also edit a
specific interface by clicking on its number or on its name. If you are
running topology discovery, you will probably see neighbor information.
If for some reason the topology discovery process cannot detect a
neighbor, you can add it manually by clicking on the [add] button in the
neighbor column.

Manually adding a neighbor sets the "Neighbor Fixed" flag in the
Interface object. This flag prevents the topology discovery process from
removing the neighbor relationship.

>**Tip**
Neighbor relationships tend to change frequently as hardware is replaced
and connections are moved. Therefore, fixed neighbor settings can become
out of date pretty soon. It is preferable to let the topology discovery
process maintain neighbor relationships.

#### Modules Tab: If the device provides module information via SNMP,
Netdot will show it in this tab. Modules are shown hierarchically based
on how they are contained within each other.

#### IP Info Tab: This section lists all the IP addresses found in the
device, together with the subnets they belong in, the device interface
where they were found, and optionally, their DNS names.

Near the end of this section, you will find an option to set the "Auto
DNS" flag on all interfaces with IP addresses. The purpose of this flag
is to tell Netdot whether it should generate DNS names for each IP
address based on the interface name and the device name.

The logic of this operation is handed off to a plugin module, which means
that you can write your own plugin to generate DNS names based on your own
naming scheme (see configuration file for more details). The included
plugin generates names such as "ge-0-1.router1.mydomain.com", assuming
that the device name is router1 and that the interface is GigabitEthernet0/1.
This is very useful when you are using the traceroute utility.

For this to work you need the following:

* The device has to have its "Auto DNS" flag set (Basics section of the
  device page).
* Each interface with an IP address on the device has to have the "Auto
  DNS flag on"
* The IP address must exist within an IP block which has been assigned
  a DNS zone (Management -> Address Space). Alternatively, the 
  option AUTO_DNS_ZONE specifies the name of the zone to use.
* For PTR records to be generated as well, the IP block must have a
  reverse zone (in-addr.arpa or ip6.arpa) associated with it.

You can generate these records in two ways:

a) By clicking on the button that reads "Re-generate DNS names for all IPs"
   at the bottom of the IP info tab of the device page. This will act 
   on only that device
b) By using the updatedevices.pl executable as follows:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/updatedevices.pl -DN
~~~~

The command above will instruct Netdot to generate DNS records for all
IPs belong to device interfaces, as long as the criteria explained earlier 
are met.

#### BGP Peers Tab: If the device is a router with BGP peering sessions,
and those are seen via SNMP, Netdot will show that information in this
tab. Information includes the remote IP address, the BGP ID and the AS.
The BGPPeering record also includes fields to document things such as
the maximum number of allowed IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes, whether the peering
should be monitored (e.g. with Nagios), etc.

For each AS discovered, Netdot tries to look up its information using
WHOIS. If the information is found, an entity record is created with
the AS number, AS name, etc. You can expand this record to include
contact information, comments, etc.

#### Topology Tab: Netdot can use the neighbor relationships from the
device interface to draw a graph of this device and its neighbors.
By default, Netdot only shows directly connected neighbors. However,
you can expand the graph to include neighbors of neighbors by
specifying a larger "Search Depth" value.

## VLANs

Netdot creates VLANs when these are found in devices. You can add
additional information to the VLAN record, such as a description,
or comments. 

When viewing a VLAN, you can see which interfaces in which devices
are currently members (or trunks) of that VLAN. Also, in the device
page you can see which VLANs are configured on each interface.

Currently Netdot assumes that VLANs are unique. If your VLAN IDs are
reused around your network for different physical segments, Netdot 
information could be confusing. We intend to address this limitation
in a future release.

### Finding VLANs

You can search for specific VLANs by going to "Management" -> "VLANs".
Netdot will match the search string against VLAN IDs (numbers) or names.

### VLAN Groups

VLAN Groups are basically VLAN ID ranges that can help organize your 
VLAN assignments. For example, you might want to assign all your VOIP
VLANs from the range 2000-2500.

You can create a VLAN group by going to "Management" -> "VLANs" and
clicking on [new]. Provide a name for the group and a range of IDs.

## Assets

An asset in Netdot is a record which contains information about
device hardware. For example, serial number, inventory number, MAC address,
product name, etc. 

The difference between an Asset and a Device in Netdot is that a Device is
an Asset which has been deployed and discovered.

Asset records can be used to document equipment that is not yet deployed.
Once the asset is discovered in the network, it is referenced by the new
device or device module record. 

### Importing Assets

Go to Management -> Assets -> [import]
This form allows you to import multiple hardware assets. For example, you
can use a bar code scanner to scan the information from vendor boxes as you
receive your equipment.

Create a text file composed of part number, serial number, and optionally
other fields. The part number must match the value from an existing product
in Netdot. The order of fields in each line must match the list of fields in
the "Fields for import" select menu.

Once imported, you can view a report of your assets in the Reports section.

## IP Address Space Management

Netdot can be helpful in managing IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces. Some of
its key features are:

*   Address space is hierarchically organized through the use of a fast
    binary tree algorithm, which is the same technique used by routers
    when doing prefix lookups.

*   New subnets can be automatically created based on the interface
    configuration retrieved from routers and firewalls.

*   Visualization of used vs. available address space for easier
    block and address allocations

*   DNS and DHCP configuration management

### IP blocks

IP objects are called IP blocks. These objects can represent individual
end-node addresses, as well as groups of addresses. The distinguishing
characteristic is the prefix attribute. For example, an IPv4 block with
a 32 bit prefix is an end-node address, while a block with a 24 prefix
represents a group of 254 end-node addresses.

Each address or block has a corresponding status. Let's see those in
detail.

#### IP block Status

IP objects are assigned a status to better represent their nature.
Depending on whether the IP is an end address or a block, different
status values can be assigned.

The status of an end-node address can be one of:

*   *Static*: These are addresses that have been statically assigned to
    hosts or device interfaces.

*   *Dynamic*: Addresses that belong to a DHCP pool

*   *Discovered*: Addresses that have not been assigned as static or
    dynamic, but have been seen on the network (as part of ARP entries,
    for example).

*   *Reserved*: Addresses that should not be assigned

*   *Available*: Addresses that were previously used, but have been
    freed.

On the other hand, the status of an IP block can be one of:

*   *Container*: This kind of block is meant to group or contain other
    blocks, such as Subnet blocks or other Container blocks. For
    example, let's say your whole IPv4 address space is 192.168.0.0/16.
    You also have partitioned this space into two /17 blocks, and from
    these blocks, you allocate subnets that you configure in your
    routers. In this case, you would have:

    ~~~~
    192.168.0.0/16 -> Container
        192.168.0.0/17  -> Container
            192.168.0.1/24 -> Subnet
            192.168.0.2/24 -> Subnet
        192.168.128.0/17 -> Container
            192.168.128.10/24 -> Subnet
            192.168.128.20/24 -> Subnet
    ~~~~

*   *Subnet*: This kind of block is meant to represent actual subnets that
    are configured on the interfaces of your layer 3 devices such as
    routers or firewalls. Subnets usually contain the end-node addresses
    that you assign to your users.

*   *Reserved*: Similarly to reserved addresses, reserved blocks are not
    supposed to be allocated for whatever reason.

#### Associating IP blocks with other objects

IP blocks can be linked to sites in a many-to-many relationship. A site
can use one or more IP blocks and one IP block can be in use at one or
more sites.

Similarly, IP blocks can be linked to DNS zones. This helps Netdot
determine which domain a new DNS A, AAAA or PTR record should belong
to.

## DNS

Netdot can maintain DNS zone data. Zones can be exported as text files
to be used by DNS server software. Currently, only ISC BIND zone file
exporting is supported.

>**Tip**
The mechanisms by which zone files are transferred to and loaded by
authoritative name servers are left to the administrator. A simple way
to do this is by running a name server locally in the machine that runs
Netdot, and saving those zone files in the location where the software
can load them periodically. A more complex setup could involve saving
these files into revision control systems (CVS, SVN, etc), which could
then be used by system configuration engines like Puppet or CfEngine to
run syntax checks and load them into the appropriate name servers.

Netdot supports the following DNS records: A, AAAA, CNAME, DS, HINFO,
LOC, MX, NAPTR, PTR, SRV, and TXT.

You can import your existing BIND zones into netdot with the help of the
tool `import_bind_zones.pl` from the import subdirectory

~~~~
 usage: import/import_bind_zones.pl
  [ -n|domain <name>, -f|file <path> ] (for single zone)
  [ -c|config <path>, -d|dir <path>  ] (for multiple zones)
  [ -g|--debug ] [-h|--help]

  -c  --config <path>   Bind config file containing zone definitions
  -d, --dir <path>      Directory where zone files are found
  -n, --domain <name>   Domain or Zone name
  -f, --zonefile <path> Zone file
  -w, --wipe            Wipe out existing zone data
  -g, --debug           Print debugging output
  -h, --help            Print help
~~~~

To add a new zone manually, go to `Management -> DNS Zones` and provide a
name for the zone. Optionally, select an existing zone which you would
like to use as a template. This will tell Netdot to basically clone this
template zone and all its records, but saving it with the name you
provide. This is useful in cases when multiple zones share the same
information, such as NS records, MX records, etc. Click on [add]. You
will see a new zone created using the values from the template zone, or
with default values extracted from the configuration file.

Once a zone is created, it should be linked to an IP block (Subnet or
Container). You can do this by clicking on the [add] button of the IP
blocks section in the zone page.

The most convenient way to create reverse zones (in-addr.arpa or
ip6.arpa) is to go to the corresponding IP block page, DNS Zones
section, and click on [add]. If the corresponding reverse zone does not
exist, Netdot will present the user with the appropriate zone name and
an option to create it. This is especially useful with IPv6 blocks,
which tend to require very long reverse zone names.

At this point, you can add new records by clicking on the [add] button
on the Records section. Records can also be added from other parts of
the user interface, for example, from the IP address page, or the DNS
Records page.

Records can also be imported in bulk into the zone by going to the Zone
page, clicking on the [import] button of the Records section and pasting
the text from a BIND zone file into the text box.

Each time the zone or its contents are modified, the transaction is
added to a list of pending changes. This list is kept in a database
table called "hostaudit" and is used to determine when a zone needs to
be exported. Zones can be exported manually via the UI by going to the
Export menu, or via cron jobs. When a zone is exported, its serial number
is increased and the changes' "pending" status is cleared.

### The '@' record

In Netdot, as in BIND, the '@' record symbolizes the domain (a.k.a "zone
apex"). In order to add records that apply to the domain itself, such as
NS records, MX records, A records, etc. this record must exist. At zone
creation time, Netdot automatically adds this record, together with two
NS records for the zone, with the names (ns1.zone.name and
ns2.zone.name).

## DHCP

Netdot can maintain DHCP information and generate configurations for ISC
DHCPD.

DHCP information is organized hierarchically around the DHCP Scope
object. Netdot supports scopes of the following types: global, subnet,
shared-subnet, group, and host. Each of these scopes can be assigned one
or more attributes.

### Global Scopes

A global scope will represent a DHCP server (or a pair of failover
servers). Attributes in this scope are the default attributes inherited
by all other scopes. Attributes in more specific scopes override the
global scope attributes.

To create a new global scope, go to `Management->DHCP`. Click on the
[new] button. Assign the scope a name (for example, the host name of
your DHCP server) and select type "global". Global scopes are not
contained by any other scope, so leave the Container field unselected.

Once a scope is created, you can add attributes to it. For example,
click on the [attributes] button and then [add]. You will see a new page
where you can create a new attribute. Let's say, for example, that you
want to add a list of name servers. Type "name-servers" in the Name
search box and click on "List". Select the "domain-name-servers"
attribute name from the list and add a list of values. Then click
Insert.

### Subnet Scopes

Subnet scopes contain attributes that apply to all hosts within a
subnet. Subnet scopes are contained by a global scope.

The easiest way to enable DHCP for a particular subnet is from within
the Subnet page. First, make sure that the subnet exists (you can create
it manually or by discovering the router that serves that subnet). You
can view the subnet by going to `Management -> Address Space` and
navigating to where the subnet is, or by simply searching for its
address.

Once in the subnet page, look for the Dhcp Scope section and click on
[enable]. This will bring an input section where you can select the
global scope and the routers option. By default, Netdot shows the first
address of the subnet as the routers option value. You can change this
value if your router interface has a different address. Click [Save]. You
will now see the subnet scope listed in the Subnet page. You can click
on the scope name and that will take you to the DHCP Scope page, from
which you can add any other necessary attributes.

### Host Scopes

Host scopes allow you to assign attributes that apply to particular
hosts. Host scopes also link a host's Ethernet address with its IP
address.

You can create a new host scope from the host page.

*   First of all, a Static IP address object needs to exist. You can
    create new static IP objects by selecting the desired address from
    the Subnet page.

*   Once the Static IP address is created, you need to give it name. Look
    for the DNS A records section and click on [add].

*   Once you provide a name for the A record, you will be redirected to
    the host page. Here, find the `DHCP for <IP address>` section and
    click on [add]. Type the Ethernet address and save your changes.
    If you don't see a `DHCP for <IP address>` section, the IP is not
    within a subnet that has DHCP enabled.

*   When you click on the Ethernet address, you'll go to the MAC address
    page, which has a "DHCP Scopes" section. Clicking on the IP address
    will take you to the DHCP scope page. Here, you can add any specific
    attributes for that specific host.

### Template Scopes

A template scope is not a real scope, but only a collection of
attributes that you want to apply to things as a group. For example, the
DHCP host scope for an IP phone may have one or more attributes that
define where it should get its configuration from and other things. You
can create a template containing these attributes and then use that
template each time you create a host scope for IP phones.

### Active and Inactive Scopes

The 'active' flag in the scope object determines whether this scope
will be used while exporting DHCP configurations. For example, if you
wish to document the assignment of IP addresses to MAC addresses in
a given subnet, but you do not want to run DHCP on that subnet, you
can create a Subnet scope and make it inactive.

Similarly to DNS records, DHCP changes are recorded in the "hostaudit"
table, which Netdot uses to determine whether the DHCP configuration
needs to be exported. Once exported, all changes' "pending" status
is cleared.

## Contact Information

Netdot uses the concept of "Contact Lists" to show contact information
for different objects, for example devices, sites, entities
(departments, providers, etc.).

A Person object in Netdot contains a person's information, including
location, e-mail address, phone numbers, pager numbers, etc.

Since a given person often times is the point of contact for different
things, a person can have many "roles", which link that person with a
particular Contact List.

You can create new Person, Entity, Site and Contact List objects by
going to the Contacts section.

## Cable Plant

Netdot allows you to document inter-building and intra-building fiber
and copper wiring, closets, jacks, etc.

### Sites
Sites are usually buildings with one or more floors, closets and rooms.
Sites can be associated with other things, such as people, departments,
subnets, etc.

To create a new Site, go to Cable Plant -> Sites and click on [new].
You will need to enter a name. The "Site ID" is a value that can represent
the (shorter) unique identification of that building within the organization.

You can also insert pictures of Sites in the database.

### Closets
Communications closets house network equipment and cable terminations.
A Closet is located in a Room, which is located in a Floor, which is
located in a Site.

To create a new Closet, go to Cable Plant -> Closets and click on [new].
It is also possible to include pictures of closets in the database. This
is useful for technicians that might want to review the physical
characteristics of the closet space without visiting it in person.

### Backbone Cables
Backbone cables exist between two closets.

* If a physical cable traverses closets in various sites, for the purpose
  of documentation,those sections of cable should be represented as
  different backbone cables.

* Backbone cables can interconnect closets within the same site (risers).

New backbone cables can be created by going to Cable Plant -> Backbone Cables
and clicking on [new]. You will be asked to provide the origin and destination
closets, the type of cable (Copper Bundle, Fiber, etc), and a cable ID.
Netdot can suggest a cable ID value, which will be composed of the endpoint
Site IDs and a sequence number, for example "123/456-1".

The field "Number of Strands" will tell Netdot to create that many strands
associated with the new cable.

### Fiber Strands
Backbone cables contain strands. These have several attributes, including:

* Sequence number
* Status - Not Terminated, Available, Damaged, In Use
* Fiber Type - Multimode or Single Mode
* Circuit - An end-to-end circuit composed of sequences of strands

You can modify ranges of strands from a backbone as a group. For example,
if you have a new hybrid fiber cable with 24 strands, of which 12 are single
mode and the other 12 are multi-mode, at the backbone page, after the
list of strands, type Range: 1-12, then select Type: "Single Mode",
Status: "Not Terminated". Do similarly for range 13-24.

Fiber strands from different backbone cables can be spliced together
to form a sequence. To splice a range of strands, go to the bottom of
the Backbone Cable page, and in the section "Manually Splice Strand Range",
type the range of strands that are spliced to another backbone,
for example, "1-12", and the corresponding strands from the next backbone,
say "1-12" or "13-24", then select the other backbone cable, and click "Go"
You should now see the contiguous strands in the "Spliced With" column,
and the whole sequence in "Part of Sequence".

### Circuits
After you have created sequences of strands from origin A to destination
B, you can now create a circuit to group those strands and assign it to
existing device interfaces.

To create a new circuit, go to Cable Plant -> Circuits and click on [new].
You will need to give it a unique identifier, and specify a provider. In
this case, the provider might be your own organization. Circuits can also
be used to document links provided by other parties. In those cases the
circuit would probably not be associated with fiber strands that you own.

Circuits have these attributes, among others:

* Site Link: A record that ties two sites that are linked by this circuit.
  A link between two sites can use more than one circuit.
* Status: Active, Disabled, Disconnected, Pending
* Type: DS3, Ethernet, Frame Relay, etc.
* Speed: 45Mbps, 100Mbps, etc.
* Loss: Last measured loss on the circuit

Once you have created the circuit, you will have the option of associating
a list of strand sequences. Simply select the origin and destination sites,
then select a pair of sequences that compose this circuit (a pair, assuming
that it's a fiber circuit).

You can associate existing device interfaces to this circuit.

### Horizontal Cables
A horizontal cable represents cabling that starts in a closet and terminates
in a wall jack, usually Cat5 or similar. These are some of their attributes:

* Jack ID: The unique identifier of the jack in the organization. For example,
  a jack located in Site #123, terminated in closet "A" and whose sequence
  is 456, could be labeled uniquely with something like "123-A-456".
* Faceplate ID: Normally, faceplates contain more than one jack. This is the
  unique identifier of the faceplate, not the jack.
* Type: Cat5, Cat6, etc.
* Closet: The closet where the cable is terminated (one end)
* Room: The room where the cable is terminated (the other end)

Once created, you can assign this horizontal cable to a device interface
by going to the Device page, selecting "Interfaces" and [edit]. You should
see a list of existing cables in the "Jack(cable)" column. Notice that
there are also free-form fields in the "Room" and "Jack" columns. These
are available in case you don't need to document the cable, but just
the interface-to-jack relationship.

## Advanced DB operations

The Advanced section of the top menu shows basic Browse, Search and Add
operations on particular tables of the database. This often requires
certain familiarity with the database schema.

In this section you can also write your own SQL queries, which can be
saved for future use. SQL query output can also be saved in
comma-separated (CSV) format.

## Reports

The Reports section provides a number of useful types of reports.

### Device Reports

#### By Type/Model

Lists devices grouped by type (switches, routers, servers, etc), then by
model, and gives a total count per type and model.

#### By Model/OS

Lists devices by manufacturer, then model, showing each model's
recommended OS version (which you would have had to previously specify)
and all the other existing versions of that OS in your network, with
counts.

#### Device in Downtime

Since Netdot can be used to export configurations for monitoring tools
(e.g. Nagios), particular devices can be assigned a downtime period,
which will exclude them from the monitoring tool during the time frame
specified. This report shows you all the devices that are within a
downtime period.

#### Duplex Mismatches

This report shows a list of neighboring device interfaces whose duplex
settings are mismatched.

#### VLAN mismatches

This report shows a list of pairs of connected device interfaces
whose list of VLANs differs. Interfaces can be set up as trunks, in
which case they will usually carry tagged VLAN traffic for more than
one VLAN, or just members of a VLAN. Unfortunately the report is not 
perfect because it would require knowledge about whether a VLAN is 
tagged or not. Currently this information is consistently available
depending on the vendor and the model of the switch.

#### OS mismatches

This report lists devices whose operating system version differs from
the recommended version. The list is grouped by manufacturer, then
model, then device name and it shows the current OS version.


### Asset Reports

Asset reports are most useful for identifying existing device hardware,
be it installed or not installed.

#### By Type/Model

Gives a summary of device hardware by type and model, and shows
quantities of each.

#### Detailed

Shows a list of assets including their type, model serial number, inventory
number, whether it has been installed or not, comments, etc.

### IP Reports

#### Unused Subnets

Here you will see a list of subnets that have no IP addresses. You can
select only IPv4 subnets or IPv6 subnets.

#### Maxed out Subnets

This report lists subnets that are used beyond a given threshold. This
threshold is configurable by modifying the `SUBNET_USAGE_MINPERCENT`
item in the `etc/Site.conf` file

#### Unused Static Addresses

This report shows static addresses that have not been seen in the
network for a given time. This makes it easy to free up subnet address
space.

### MAC Addresses

This report shows a list of MAC address OUIs, sorted by number of
addresses. You have the option to include all addresses, only MAC
addresses belonging to infrastructure devices or only MAC addresses
found in ARP caches and forwarding tables.

# Exporting Configurations for External Programs

You can use the exporter tool to generate text files that can be used as
configurations for third-party tools and programs.

The exporter tool is available in the web UI, under the Export tab.
Simply select one or more programs and click on the [submit] button.
Netdot will show output from the exporter tool, including the paths
to the new files.

Additionally, the exporter can be called from the command line. For
example, to generate Nagios configurations:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/exporter.pl -t Nagios
~~~~

Or you can export several in one call:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# bin/exporter.pl -t Nagios,Sysmon,Rancid,Smokeping,BIND,DHCPD
~~~~

There are specific export parameters for each of these which you can
customize by editing your `Site.conf` file.

## Cacti Integration

Cacti integration is done a little differently (it's more of an
"import" than an "export"). You will find a script called
`netdot_to_cacti.php` under export/cacti in the Netdot package. This
script should be placed(together with its configuration file) in your
Cacti's cli directory(it doesn't need to be the same machine running
Netdot, but you need to make sure that the script can connect to Mysql
on the Netdot machine).You will then need to run it periodically via
CRON, say, once a day.

# Authorization

Starting with version 0.9, netdot supports role-based authorization.

There are three types of users that correspond with levels of access in
Netdot:

*   Admin: Full access to the UI and operations on objects.

*   Operator: Full access to the UI, but read-only access to objects.

*   User: Limited UI, with view, edit, and delete access to particular
    objects.

## Assigning permissions to users

Permissions can be assigned to individuals or to groups. Individuals are
grouped in contact lists. A user who is a member of a contact list
inherits the permissions from the list. However, the individual can have
more specific permissions (or no permissions) if necessary.

There is a limited number of objects which unprivileged users can gain
access to:

*   DNS records: Users can create, modify and delete records from a
    certain zone. Permissions can be given for the entire zone or for
    subsets of it, based on IP blocks. For example, if a user is given
    view, edit and delete permissions to myzone.com, he or she can view,
    modify and remove any record from that zone. On the other hand, if
    the zone covers hosts from a supernet, i.e. 10.0.0.0/16, and the
    user should only have control on records within a particular subnet,
    i.e. 10.0.0.0/24, instead of assigning permissions on myzone.com,
    the administrator can assign view, edit and delete permissions on
    that particular subnet.

*   When creating new DNS records, users with 'edit' rights on a subnet
    do not have the option to choose specific IP addresses. This helps
    keep ranges of IP addresses together so that Subnets can be resized
    more easily if necessary. If the Netdot administrator wishes to
    grant such rights to a user or group, there is a right called
    'Choose IP' which allows that.

*   Device interfaces: Users can view port details such as number, name,
    vlan, room, jack, description and neighbor. A user can only edit the
    room, jack and description fields. To assign permissions to a user
    on a list of devices, select the Device class and then select one or
    more devices to which the user can have access.

*   Contact Lists: A user can add, modify and delete contacts from given
    contact lists.

To assign permissions for an individual user, perform the following
tasks:

*   Make sure there is a Person object for the user. You can verify if a
    Person object exists by going to `Contacts -> People` and searching
    for the person's name in the Search box. If the object does not
    exist, you can create a new one by clicking on the [new] button on
    the upper right corner of the same window.

*   Make sure that the person object has a Username and a User Type set.
    If you have configured netdot to use external authentication,
    make sure that the username corresponds with the login information
    in those external authentication systems. If you are using local
    authentication instead, make sure that you set a local password
    using the Password field.

*   On the Person page, you can add permissions by clicking on the
    [access\_rights] button. This will display current permissions. You
    can now add new ones by clicking on the [add] button on the right.

*   On the UserRight window, select the Object Class, the specific
    object or objects, and one or more access rights (view, edit,
    delete). Only select the 'none' right to revoke all permissions
    inherited from a group. Click on `Insert`.

## Audit records

Once you give users permissions to update your Netdot database, you may
want to know who has done what. There is a special database table called
'audit', which records every database operation made by a person (meaning
that operations started by cron jobs are not recorded). Each audit record
contains the following information: time stamp, username, operation type
(insert, update, delete), table affected, record ID, record label, fields
and values affected.

You can access these records by going to "Advanced" -> "Browse" -> "audit",
or, if looking for a particular record, choose "Search" -> "audit" instead.

This table can be pruned periodically using the bin/prune_db.pl script.

# RESTful Interface

The RESTful interface allows programmatic access to the Netdot database
over the HTTP/HTTPS protocol. At this moment, all objects are formatted
in XML using the XML::Simple Perl module. In the future, Netdot may
support other formats, such as YAML or JSON.

## Generic RESTful resources

* The REST interface is available using the following URL (or similar,
depending on your Apache configuration):

~~~~
https://myserver.mydomain.com/netdot/rest/
~~~~

 This should load the Netdot::REST class and return something like:

~~~~
Netdot/1.0 REST OK.
~~~~

* Generic RESTful resources to be acted upon represent Netdot objects and are part
of the request URI. For example, in this URI:

~~~~
http://myserver.mydomain.com/netdot/rest/device/1
~~~~

 the resource is "device/1", which for a GET request, will return the contents of
Device id 1.

* Using the following URI with a GET request:

~~~~
http://myserver.mydomain.com/netdot/rest/device
~~~~

 this interface will return the contents of all Device objects in the database.

* You can also specify certain search filters to limit the scope
of a GET request:

~~~~
http://myserver.mydomain.com/netdot/rest/device?sysname=host1
~~~~

 This will perform a search and return all devices whose sysname field is 'host1'.

* The special keyword `meta_data` instead of an object ID will provide information
about the object's class:

~~~~
http://myserver.mydomain.com/netdot/rest/device/meta_data
~~~~

* An existing resource can be updated by using the 'POST' method with relevant
parameters. For example, a POST request to the following URI:

~~~~
URL: http://netdot.localdomain/rest/device/1
POST: {sysname=>'newhostname'}
~~~~

 will update the 'sysname' field of the Device object with id 1 to be "newhostname".


* Similarly, a new object can be created with a POST request. However, in this case
the object id must be left out:

~~~~
URL: http://netdot.localdomain/rest/person
POST: {firstname=>'John', lastname=>'Doe'}
~~~~

* Specific objects can be deleted by using the 'DELETE' HTTP method.

## Special-purpose REST resources

### /rest/host

The special resource '/rest/host' provides a simplified interface for manipulating
DNS and DHCP records.  We will illustrate its usage with the following examples:

#### Retrieving host data (HTTP GET)

* Retrieve all RR (DNS) objects

~~~~
http://netdot.localdomain/netdot/rest/host
~~~~

* Retrieve all RR objects within given zone

~~~~
http://netdot.localdomain/netdot/rest/host?zone=localdomain
~~~~

* Retrieve RR name "foo" and its related records

~~~~
http://netdot.localdomain/netdot/rest/host?name=foo
~~~~

* Retrieve RR id 1 and all related records

~~~~
http://netdot.localdomain/netdot/rest/host?rrid=1
~~~~

* Retrieve all Ipblock objects within given subnet

~~~~
http://netdot.localdomain/netdot/rest/host?subnet=192.168.1.0/24
~~~~

#### Creating new records (HTTP POST).

* Create new A record named 'host1' using next available address in given subnet
(note: do not specify an object ID):

~~~~
URL:  http://netdot.localdomain/netdot/rest/host
POST: {name='host1', subnet=>'192.168.1.0/24'}
~~~~

#### Updating existing records (HTTP POST)

* Requires passing rrid or ipid. Rename host with RR id=2

~~~~
URL:  http://netdot.localdomain/netdot/rest/host?rrid=2
POST: {name=>'newname'}
~~~~

* Update DHCP scope ethernet for Ipblock with id=3

~~~~
URL:  http://netdot.localdomain/netdot/rest/host?ipid=2
POST: {ethernet=>'DEADDEADBEEF'}
~~~~

#### Deleting records (HTTP DELETE)

* Delete hostname with RR id 3 (also frees IP)

~~~~
http://netdot.localdomain/netdot/rest/host?rrid=3
~~~~

### /rest/devinfo

This special REST resource can be used to retrieve extensive 
information about every device in the database
using a single GET request. The returned data structure is the same
one used by the NAGIOS exporter class.

### /rest/updatedev

This special REST resource can be used to import devices into Netdot,
as an alternative to using SNMP discovery. It accepts only POST requests.
An example using the Perl client library can be found in the Netdot source, at:

~~~~
import/update_dev_rest.pl
~~~~

## RESTful Interface Authorization

All user types can interact with the RESTful interface as long as they
are granted permissions to do so. However only Admin users can edit
or delete objects using generic REST resources. Operators and regular
users can view generic resources but can only edit or delete them
using specific-purpose resources such as 'rest/host'.

## Client module on CPAN

A convenient module is provided via CPAN for use in Perl scripts that
need to access Netdot's REST interface. The module name is
Netdot::Client::REST. It can be installed by doing something like this:

If you are on a Debian-based system:

~~~~ {.bash}
~# apt-get install libnetdot-client-rest-perl
~~~~

or

~~~~ {.bash}
~# cpan
>install Netdot::Client::REST
~~~~

# Database Maintenance

## Pruning data

Netdot's database will grow with time, thus it will be necessary to
remove old information as it becomes stale. You will find a CLI utility
called "prune_db.pl" in the bin/ directory of the distribution. 

The sample CRON file "netdot.cron" included with the package contains recommended
uses of this command.

>**Note**:
Be especially careful when using the -I and -M options to remove old IP and MAC
addresses. The criteria for deletion relies on the "last seen" timestamp on
these records. That means that if Netdot is not collecting ARP and FWT tables
from the routers, firewalls and switches where these addresses can be seen in
the network, then Netdot will assume that they are not active anymore, thus
included for deletion.

## Updating OUI information

At installation time, Netdot inserts organizationally unique identifier (OUI) data 
from IEEE into the database. You can update this data by running the following command 
from the Netdot source directory:

~~~~
make oui
~~~~
