-- vismPortConfig group

-- This port configuration group is used for configuring the virtual
-- port between VISM and PXM. This group contains only a single port
-- which is the network port.
-- 
-- The virtual port has to be configured before
-- adding LCN(Logical Channel Numbers) connections. 
-- All the LCNs are added on the same port.
