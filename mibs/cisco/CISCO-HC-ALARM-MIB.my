            same structure as the object(s) representing the high 
            capacity absolute value.

            If the associated object instance(s) representing the high
            capacity absolute value could not be accessed during the
            sampling interval, and is therefore invalid, then the

            Because SNMP access control is articulated entirely in terms

            the alarm mechanism, the probe must only grant write access
