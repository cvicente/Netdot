          including the generation of the TCF training signal.

          There are un ratified proposals on the table to extend

          gateway is limited to the ITU T-series protocol, the value

          Country Code field to preclude non-standard synchronization 
          of the group 3 faxs terminals. 
          Since a value of 0x00 refers to Japan, and a value of 0xFF 
          is a Country Code extension mechanism, these cannot be used 
          to disable non-standard synchronization. 

          The t38NSFCountryCode value used to override NSF-based
          synchronization is 0xAD (173). 
          If the Country Code is extended to two bytes in the future, 
          the second byte will be set to 0x00. In conjunction with
          this Country Code, a t38NSFVendorCode value of 0x0051

          value of 0x0000 for this suppression since it refers to
          Compression Labs.
