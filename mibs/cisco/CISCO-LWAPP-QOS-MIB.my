        DESCRIPTION             
                "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
                devices operating as Central controllers, that
                terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
                tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

                Information provided by this MIB is used to study
                the quality of service in the voice and video traffic
                on the WLAN.

                The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
                can be depicted as follows:

                The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
                the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
                the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

                LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
                controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
                that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
                The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
                wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
                the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                                   GLOSSARY

                Access Point ( AP )

                An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
                control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
                and provides access to the distribution services via
                the wireless medium for associated clients.  

                LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
                LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
                it is logically connected.

                Gratuitous Probe Response (GPR)

                The Gratuitous Probe Response feature aids in conserving
                battery power of WLAN-enabled cell phones by providing
                a high rate packet on the order of tens of milliseconds
                such that these kind of phones can wake up and wait at
                predefined intervals, to reduce battery power.  The 
                GPR packet is transmitted from the AP at a predefined
                time interval.
                 

                Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP )

                This is a generic protocol that defines the 
                communication between the Access Points and the
                Central Controller. 

                Mobile Node ( MN )

                A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
                network associated with an access point. Mobile Node 
                and client are used interchangeably. 

                TU

                A measurement of time in units of 1024 microseconds.
