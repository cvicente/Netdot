    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module manages the GPRS Tunnelling Protocol
        (GTP) on GGSN and SGSN.

        GPRS provides wireless access to packet data network on
        the GSM infrastructure.

        The following diagram illustrates a simplified GPRS
        logical architecture with the name of inter-node
        interface:

        GTP is the protocol between GSN nodes (GSN peers) in
        the GPRS backbone network. It includes both the GTP
        signalling and data transfer procedures.

        GTP is used both on the Gn interface, i.e. the interface
        between GSN peers with in a PLMN, and the Gp
        interface between GSN peers in different PLMNs.

        SGSN is the serving GPRS support node, it responsible 
        for the delivery of data packets from and to the MS 
        within its service area.

        GGSN is the gateway GPRS support node, it provides 
        interworking with external PDN and is connected with 
        SGSNs via an IP-based GPRS backbone network.

        The GTP protocol is implemented only by SGSNs and GGSN.

        A PDP Context is an information set maintained by MS 
        and GSNs which describes the mobile wireless service
        call or session.

        A Qos Profile is associated with each PDP context which
        defines multiple attributes like precedence, delay, 
        reliability, peak throughput and mean throughput.
        Based on the precedence, delay and mean throughput an
        user is classified into one of the three Qos classes:
        Best Effort, Normal and Premium.

        Mean throughput is measured at the Gi and R reference 
        points in units of octets per second. It specifies the 
        average rate at which data is expected to be 
        transferred across the GPRS network during the 
        remaining lifetime of an activated PDP context.

        A MAP converting GSN is responsible for converting GTP
        messages to and from MAP messages.  This helps in the
        communication with HLR.

    DESCRIPTION
        "Modified the default value for cGtpMaximumPdps from
        1000 to 10000.

        Added 'gtpdirector' to the enumeration of cGtpService.

        The APN identifies whether the network is corporate 
        or service provider network.  

        The Single Access point feature enables the
        service provider to add new access-points to the GGSN
        without having to provision the HLR. The requests are
        sent by the SGSN to the same virtual APN. A virtual
        APN is not associated with any actual physical
        network.  The GGSN processes the request and forwards
        the packet to the appropriate access-point that is
        specified in the PCO. This feature is supported only
        in Cisco GGSNs.

        The purpose of the GTP-Director is to provide a
        mechanism for service providers using non-Cisco GGSN
        to use the Single APN feature.

        The GTP-Director also provides load balancing, using 
        round robin mechanism, across GGSNs.  The
        Cisco GGSNs may use the GTP-Director, but is not
        necessary as they can use IOS-SLB ( Server Load
        Balancing )."
