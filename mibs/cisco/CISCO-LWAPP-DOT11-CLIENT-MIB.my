        DESCRIPTION             
                "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
                devices operating as Central controllers, that
                terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
                tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

                Information provided by this MIB is about the
                configuration and monitoring of 802.11 wireless
                clients in the network.

                The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
                can be depicted as follows:

                The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
                the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
                the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

                LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
                controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
                that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
                The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
                wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
                the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                                   GLOSSARY

                Access Point ( AP )

                An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
                control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
                and provides access to the distribution services via
                the wireless medium for associated clients.  

                LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
                LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
                it is logically connected.

                Basic Service Set ( BSS ) 

                Coverage area of one access point is called a BSS. An 
                access point (AP) acts as a master to control the 
                clients within that BSS. 

                Clear To Send (CTS)

                Refer to the description of RTS.                

                Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) 

                This is a generic protocol that defines the 
                communication between the Access Points and the
                Central Controller.

 
                MAC Service Data Units ( MSDU )

                The MSDU is that unit of data that is received from 
                the logical link control ( LLC ) sub-layer which lies
               above the medium access control ( MAC ) sub-layer in a
                protocol stack. 

                Message Integrity Code ( MIC )

                A value generated by a symmetric key cryptographic 
                function. If the input data are changed, a new value 
                cannot be correctly computed without knowledge of the
                symmetric key. Thus, the secret key protects the input 
                data from undetectable alteration.
  
                Mobile Node ( MN )

                A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
                network associated with an access point. Mobile Node,
                Mobile Station(Ms) and client are used 
                interchangeably. 

                Request To Send ( RTS )

                A client wishing to send data initiates the process by
                sending a Request To Send (RTS) frame. The destination
                client replies with a Clear To Send (CTS) frame.

                Wireless local-area network ( WLAN )
                A local-area network that uses high-frequency radio 
                waves rather than wires to communicate between nodes.
        
                Workgroup Bridge ( WGB )
                A WGB can provide a wireless infrastructure connection
                for a Ethernet-enabled devices. Devices that do not have
                a wireless client adapter in order to connect to the
                wireless network can be connected to a WGB through 
                Ethernet port.
