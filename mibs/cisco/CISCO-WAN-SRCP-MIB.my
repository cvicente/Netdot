            "The MIB module for managing SRCP(Simple Resource
             Coordination Protocol) implementations. SRCP
             is a resource coordination protocol used
             between a MGC(Media Gateway Controller) and
             a MG(Media Gateway). SRCP MIB is applicable
             to both controllers (SRCP clients) and gateways
             (SRCP servers).

         When an entry is deleted from mgcResolutionTable,
         the row with the corresponding IP address in this table
         will be deleted.
            
         2. Case of External address resolution : If there is at
            least one Call agent whose IP address is resolved
            externally, an entry is created whenever SRCP
            communication occurs with a new IP address. Table
            entries are never deleted, but must be 
            nonpersistent in agent implementations, i.e. must be
            purged in case of a system shutdown/restart.
