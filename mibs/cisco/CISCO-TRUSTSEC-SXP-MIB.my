    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module is for the configuration and status query
        of SGT Exchange Protocol over TCP (SXPoTCP) feature of the
        device on the Cisco's Trusted Security (TrustSec) system.

        Security Group Tag (SGT) identifying its source, assigned to a
        packet on ingress to a TrustSec cloud, and used to determine
        security and other policy to be applied to it along its path
        through the cloud.

        SXPoTCP protocol extends the original SGT Exchange Protocol
        (SXP) protocol to enable a much wider array of deployment
        scenarios.  This MIB uses the term SXP to refer to SXPoTCP.

        TrustSec secures a network fabric by authenticating and
        authorizing each device connecting to the network, allowing
        for the encryption, authentication and replay protection of data
        traffic on a hop by hop basis.  SXP allows the deployment
        of RBACL, a key component of the TrustSec architecture, in the
        absence of TrustSec capable hardware."
