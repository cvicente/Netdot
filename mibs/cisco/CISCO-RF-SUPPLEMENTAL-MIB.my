    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB was designed to complement the CISCO-RF-MIB by 
        providing additional optional status and configuration control 
        for redundant CPU platforms.
        
        However, the MIB should also be applicable to redundant 
        platforms which don't use the RF Redundancy Framework software 
        since it makes no direct references to any CISCO-RF-MIB objects 
        or textual conventions and no direct reference to any RF 
        states, RF events or internal information.
        
        Glossary of terms used in this document:

            Active -   A redundant CPU which is actively controlling 
                       the system.

            Running configuration - The runtime configuration of a
                       system which reflects current configured 
                       hardware or software settings. Runtime 
                       configuration which is not stored in 
                       non-volatile memory may be lost if the system
                       loses power.

            Standby -  A redundant CPU which is not currently 
                       controlling the system, but which can take 
                       over control if the Active CPU fails.

            Startup configuration - A copy of system configuration
                       stored in non-volatile memory which can be
                       applied following a system powerup.

                       For platforms where all runtime configuration
                       is automatically stored in a non-volatile
                       manner, the running and startup configurations
                       are always identical.

            Switchover - The transfer of control from one CPU to a 
                       redundant CPU.

            Sync -     The mirroring (or synchronizing) of system 
                       state, configuration, statistics or other 
                       information from the Active CPU to a Standby 
                       CPU to allow it to maintain full system control        
                       following a switchover."

    MAX-ACCESS read-only
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The date and time when this system began providing 
        uninterrupted operation. This includes the time while either 
        redundant unit was Active, but may also include brief intervals 
        during switchover where the new Active unit was operational, 
        but not yet reachable for network management purposes. It may 
        also include intervals where no Standby unit was offering 
        protection, as long as the Active unit was still operational.  
        
        It normally changes only if an unprotected system restart
        occurs or if a Standby unit was forced to take over before 
        the initial database sync was completed.
      
        However, it may also change if the system's Time of Day clock 
        is changed or adjusted.  This object will be inaccurate if the
        system's Time of Day clock has not been set accurately. However,
        it should be implemented in such a way that when the system's 
        Time of Day clock is adjusted to an accurate setting, 
        cRfSupSysAvailableStartTime will also adjust to show the 
        accurate available start time."

        cRfSupSysAvailableStartTime.
        
        This object will remain uninstantiated if no switchovers have 
        taken place since the current Active CPU was initialized
        or if a Standby unit was forced to take over before the 
        initial database sync was completed."

cRfSupSysRunningConfigSyncTime OBJECT-TYPE

        Since automatic running configuration syncs are event driven 
        and can be disabled by configuration, this time doesn't
        directly indicate whether Standby software reflects the
        running configuration of the Active unit.
