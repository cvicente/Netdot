    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module to describe and store events generated
        by the Cisco Embedded Event Manager.  

        The Cisco Embedded Event Manager detects hardware and software 
        faults, and other events (such as OIRs) for the system.
        It also enables users to configure fault recovery services
        for system wide components.  The Embedded Event Manager also 
        provides process reliability statistics.

        The Embedded Event Manager is a policy driven process through 
        which faults in the system are reported through a defined API.
        The Embedded Event Manager policy engine receives notifications
        when faults and other events occur.  Embedded Event Manager 
        policies implement recovery based on the current state of the 
        system and the actions specified in the policy for a given 
        event.  Recovery actions are triggered when the policy is 
        run.  Developers write and customize Embedded Event Manager 
        policies to handle faults and events."
