    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module contain the RUDP session parameter.

         The relationship between session set, session group and RUDP
         session is that: For fault tolerant case each session set
         contains two groups. Each group connects to one MGC(Media
         Gateway Controller), One active, one standby. If one MGC
         fails, the other MGC will inform the session mamager to
         switch over. If the set configuration is non-fault tolerant,
         each set contains one group.

         Each session group contains upto four RUDP sessions.

         Session set is explicitly created first, then session group
         can be created in this set. After session group is
         created, session can be created in the group.

         For deletion, session has to be deleted first. However, the
         last session can not be deleted if there is still LAPD(Link
         Access Procedure on the D-channel) entry. A group can only
         be deleted if there is no more session in it. Session set
         will be deleted when the last group in the set has been 
         deleted.
