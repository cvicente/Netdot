    DESCRIPTION
        "Metro Ethernet services can support a wide range of
        applications and subscriber needs easily, efficiently
        and cost-effectively.  Using standard Ethernet interfaces, 
        subscribers can set up secure, private Ethernet Virtual 
        Connections, to connect their sites together and connect 
        to business partners, suppliers and the Internet.

        This MIB module defines the managed objects and notifications
        describing Ethernet Virtual Connections.

        Ethernet Virtual Connections (EVC), are defined by the Metro
        Ethernet Forum (MEF), as an association between two or more
        UNIs.  Frames within an EVC can only be exchanged among the
        associated UNIs.  Frames sent into the MEN via a particular
        UNI must not be delivered back to the UNI from which it 
        originated.  

        Along an EVC path, there are demarcation flow points on 
        associated ingress and egress interface, of every device, 
        through which the EVC passes.  A service instance represents
        these flow points where a service passes through an interface.  
        From an operational perspective, a service instance serves 
        three purposes: 
            1.  Defines the instance of a particular EVC service on
                a specific interface and identifies all frames that
                belongs to that particular service/flow.
            2.  To provide the capability of applying the configured 
                features to those frames belonging to the service.
            3.  To optionally define how to forward those frames in
                the data-path.  

        The association of a service instance to an EVC depicts
        an instance of an Ethernet flow on a particular interface
        for an end-to-end (UNI-to-UNI) Ethernet service for a 
        subscriber.

        The following diagram illustrates the association of
        EVC, UNIs and service instances.  UNI physical ports
        are depicted as 'U', and service instances as 'x'.

                         -------- EVC ---------

        This MIB module addresses the functional areas of network
        management for EVC, including:

            The operational mode for interfaces that are providing
            Ethernet service(s).

            The service attributes regarding an interface behaving
            as UNI, such as CE-VLAN mapping and layer 2 control 
            protocol (eg. stp, vtp, cdp) processing.

            The provisioning of service instances to define flow 
            points for an Ethernet service.

            The operational status of EVCs for notifications
            of status changes, and EVC creation and deletion.

ServiceInstanceTarget ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Denotes a generic service instance target.

        An ServiceInstanceTarget value is always interpreted within the
        context of an ServiceInstanceTargetType value.  Every usage of
        the ServiceInstanceTarget textual convention is required to
        specify the ServiceInstanceTargetType object which provides the
        context.  It is suggested that the ServiceInstanceTargetType
        object is logically registered before the object(s) which use
        the ServiceInstanceTarget textual convention if they appear in
        the same logical row.

        The value of an ServiceInstanceTarget object must always be
        consistent with the value of the associated
        ServiceInstanceTargetType object.  Attempts to set an
        ServiceInstanceTarget object to a value which is inconsistent
        with the associated ServiceInstanceTargetType must fail with an
        inconsistentValue error.

        When this textual convention is used as the syntax of an index
        object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
        sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58.  In this
        case, the object definition MUST include a 'SIZE' clause
        to limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers."

ServiceInstanceTargetType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

        is attached.

            'other'
                None of the following.  This value MUST be used if the
                value of the corresponding ServiceInstanceTarget
                object is a zero-length string.

            'interface'
                Service instance is attached to the the interface
                defined by ServiceInstanceInterface textual
                convention.

        Each definition of a concrete ServiceInstanceTargetType value
        must be accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for
        use with that ServiceInstanceTargetType.

        To support future extensions, the ServiceInstanceTargetType
        textual convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type
        definitions.  It MAY be sub-typed in compliance statements in
        order to require only a subset of these target types for a
        compliant implementation.

        Implementations must ensure that ServiceInstanceTargetType
        objects and any dependent objects (e.g. ServiceInstanceTarget
        objects) are consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be
        generated if an attempt to change an ServiceInstanceTargetType
        object would, for example, lead to an undefined
        ServiceInstanceTarget value.  In particular,
        ServiceInstanceTargetType/ServiceInstanceTarget pairs must be

        cevcPortL2ControlProtocolType, including:


            'discard' 
                The port must discard all ingress service frames
                carrying the layer 2 control protocol service
                frames and the port must not generate any egress
                service frames carrying the layer 2 control protocol
                service frames.  When this action is set at the port,
                an EVC cannot process the layer 2 control protocol
                service frames.


            'peer' 
                The port must act as a peer, meaning it actively
                participates with the Customer Equipment, in the
                operation of the layer 2 control protocol service
                frames.  An example of this is port authentication
                service at the UNI with 802.1x or enhanced link OAM
                functionality by peering at the UNI with link OAM
                (IEEE 802.3ah).  When this action is set at the port,
                an EVC cannot process the layer 2 control protocol
                service frames.


            'passToEvc'
                The disposition of the service frames which are layer 2
                control protocol service frames must be determined by
                the layer 2 control protocol action attribute of the
                EVC, (see cevcSIL2ControlProtocolAction for further
                details).


            'peerAndPassToEvc' 
                The layer 2 control protocol service frames will be
                peered at the port and also passed to one or more EVCs
                for tunneling.  An example of this possibility is where
                an 802.1x authentication frame is peered at the UNI for
                UNI-based authentication, but also passed to a given
                EVC for customer end-to-end authentication."
