    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB applies to one or more of a set of devices
         which have connectivity through some kind of 'fabric'.
         Many features which run in such an environment require
         the exchange of information between the peer devices
         which participate in providing the feature. An example
         of the type of information exchanged is configuration
         information. It would be advantageous to have the ability
         to have configuration for a feature done on one device
         and propagated to all other devices in the fabric.
         Cisco Fabric Service (CFS) is a general mechanism for
         data distribution within the fabric that could be used
         by most features.

         A feature supported in a device may or may not be CFS 
         capable. In case a feature is CFS capable, the control
         of the CFS operations are instrumented through this MIB.

         A CFS capable feature can be enabled for data
         distribution within the fabric by the user via SNMP.
         When a CFS capable feature is enabled for data
         distribution, CFS operations can then be performed for
         that particular feature.

         As part of the CFS configuration the first mandatory step
         is to explicitly enable the feature for data distribution.
         This enabling of distribution for a feature needs to be 
         done for those devices in the fabric where the distribution
         is intended. Following this mandatory step, feature specific
         configurations can be instrumented in the respective MIBs.
         
         Once a feature is enabled for data distribution, first
         subsequent feature specific configuration SET operation
         results in a snapshot of current 'Running Configuration'
         of the feature, on the local device. This snapshot is used
         for subsequent modifications by feature specific SET 
         operations. Such modified configuration is referred to as
         'Pending Configuration'. There can only be one 'Pending
         Configuration' in the fabric. Additionally, such 'Pending
         Configuration' can be maintained within the context of
         additional scope, specific to the respective features.
         The user who initiates the creation of the 'Pending
         Configuration' is its owner. When a 'Pending Configuration'
         for a feature exists in one of the devices of the fabric,
         an attempt to create a 'Pending Configuration' for the same
         feature and on a different device by way of feature specific
         SET operation results in an error. This means feature 
         specific SET operations intended for distribution can only
         be performed on the device that has the 'Pending 
         Configuration' with it. This ensures data consistency for
         distribution.

         Once the configuration of a feature is ready to be
         distributed to all devices connected to the fabric, a
         'commit' action performed on the local device overwrites
         the local 'Running Configuration' and then distributes the
         new  local 'Running Configuration' to all other devices in
         the fabric. The successful 'commit' action also results into
         destroying of the 'Pending Configuration' and makes the
         feature available for new distribution. Any attempt to
         perform 'commit' without any modification results in to an
         error. The 'commit' action can only be performed by the
         owner of the 'Pending Configuration'.
         
         The 'Pending Configuration' can optionally be destroyed
         without any distribution. This can be done by using either
         'abort' or 'clear' action. The 'abort' action needs to
         performed only on that device where the 'Pending
         Configuration' exists and can only be performed by the owner
         of the 'Pending Configuration'. The 'clear' action can be
         initiated through any of the devices in the fabric. The
         successful 'abort' or 'clear' operation makes the feature
         available for new distribution.

         The CFS, in addition to providing the basic distribution 
         infrastructure to the CFS capable features in a stable
         fabric, also provides infrastructure to handle data 
         distribution when two stable fabrics merge.

         This MIB module is to facilitate the global level control
         (enabling/disabling) and actions (commit/abort/clear) over
         the CFS capable features in the system.
         
         Glossary of the terms used in this MIB:
         --------------------------------------
         
         VSAN                     - Virtual Storage Area Network, 
                                    similar to a VLAN.
                                    
         CFS feature Scope        - The scope of distribution.
                                    The scope provides the context 
                                    within which the CFS actions 
                                    are performed on a CFS capable 
                                    feature.
                                    
         CFS Fabric Merge         - The merging of two stable fabrics.
                                    The CFS provides infrastructure
                                    to handle data distribution for 
                                    CFS distribution enabled features
                                    when the two stable fabrics merge.
         
         CFS control and actions : 
         
         CFS Distribution Enable  - This is to enable data distribution
                                    for CFS capable feature.
                                    
         CFS Distribution Disable - This is to disable data 
                                    distribution for CFS capable 
                                    feature.
                                    
         CFS Commit               - This is to commit the 'Pending 
                                    Configuration' on the local device.
                                    This action triggers the 
                                    distribution of the 'Pending 
                                    Configuration' to all the devices
                                    in the fabric.
                                    
         CFS Abort                - This is to Destroy the 'Pending 
                                    Configuration' on the local device
                                    without any distribution. Once 
                                    local 'Pending Configuration' is
                                    destroyed, creation of 'Pending
                                    Configuration' in the local or any
                                    other device connected to the 
                                    fabric is allowed. 
                                    
         CFS Clear                - This is to Destroy the 'Pending 
                                    Configuration' that exists in any
                                    of the device in the fabric. Once
                                    'Pending Configuration' that exists
                                    with one of the devices in the
                                    fabric is destroyed, creation of
                                    'Pending Configuration' in the 
                                    local or any other device connected
                                    to the fabric is allowed.
