        DESCRIPTION
               "The MIB module for the management of Call Home feature
               within the frame  work of Cisco's Call Home 
               architecture.
               Customers deploying solutions to run mission critical
               applications such as storage solutions demand very high
               availability and Serviceability from their products
               and/or support partners.
               To meet these requirements, a feature called 
               'CallHome' is provided which allows the system
               experiencing Hardware/Software problems to 
               automatically send the relevant failure information 
               back to the Support Center at the Support Partners for 
               troubleshooting or to get replacement hardware 
               dispatched. This feature also provides advanced
               features that allow storage systems to send 
               performance, accounting and system health information 
               in addition to just the fault information."

                The context of the CallHome message depends on the 
                message. In general, all the CallHome message is sent 
                with following information : 
 
               'Subject : System Notification from '
               'TimeStamp :' 
               'Message Name :' 
               'Message Type :' 
               'Level :'  
               'Message Device ID :'  
               'Customer ID :' (optional)

               'Chassis Hardware Version :' 
               'Supervisor Software Version :' 

               Following information are required only if a hardware 
               event caused the CallHome message : 
               'Affected FRU' 
               'Affected FRU Serial Number' 
               'Affected FRU Slot :'  
               'Affected FRU Hardware Version :' 
               'Affected FRU Software Version :' 
              
               Following is required for all the messages : 
               'Command Output :'
              
               The command output may depend on the implementation and
               severity of the CallHome message. But at minimum, 
               following information which are contained in the output
               of the CLI commands must be included.
               - Hardware model
               - software version
               - context information explaining the state of the device.
               - uptime
               - brief inventory information

               The exact format depends on the format type chosen.
               For 'xml', the above information is encoded in the XML
               format. For 'fullText', above information is sent out in
               plain text. For 'shortText', only following information 
               is provided in plain text:
                  'Subject : System Notification from  '

        DESCRIPTION
            "AlertGroups are a pre-defined set of call-home alerts.
            Users can specify these alert groups for a destination
            profile, to choose the call-home alerts messages to be
            sent out to the destination. This object represents 
            the list of alert groups (alert group types)
            configured for a destination profile.

            Each 'bit' within the value of an object of this type,
            specifies a configured alertgroup type.
            Bit position '0' ( most significant bit) in the value 
            of this object is reserved.

            The value of each 'bit' (set/reset) represents whether 
            an alert group type is configured or not for a 
            particular destination profile.

            Bit position 1, represents whether the 
            'callHomeAlertGroupName' corresponding to the 
            'callHomeAlertGroupTypeIndex' 1 in the 
            'callHomeAlertGroupTypeTable' is configured or
            not for a particular destination profile.

            Bit position 2, represents whether the 
            'callHomeAlertGroupName' corresponding to the 
            'callHomeAlertGroupTypeIndex' 2 in the 
            'callHomeAlertGroupTypeTable' is configured or
            not for a particular destination profile.

            If there is no entry in the 'alertGroupTypeTable',
            with 'alertGroupTypeIndex' 'n', then
            bit position 'n' in the value of this object is
            irrelevant. 

            If the length of an object of this type is less
            than 8 bytes, then the alert group types which are 
            not represented are not considered to be part of this
            list, i.e., effectively, the string is extended to
            be of length 8 bytes by appending bytes
            containing x'00'. Note that this means that the
            zero length string represents the 'list is empty'
            value."
