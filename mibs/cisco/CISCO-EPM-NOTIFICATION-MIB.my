     DESCRIPTION
     "Notifications directly from hardware and software and processed
     notifications from various management applications can be further
     processed and forwarded by still other management applications to 
     indicate the status of devices and software (managed objects).
     The status of these managed objects can be reported by traps.
    
     The CISCO-EPM-NOTIFICATION-MIB contains the trap structure which 
     carries the identity and status info of the managed object as
     analyzed by such an event processor. It is not possible for
     receivers of these traps to query the mib objects.
     
     A unique but optional feature of the application generating the 
     trap defined in this mib is the ability to contain multiple 
     partitions in the same system running the application. A 
     'Partition' is a logical grouping of a set of managed devices. 
     These devices can belong to only one partition at any given 
     time. The trap structure will contain information on the exact 
     partition number and the partition name of the device where it 
     resides.
           
     The need for trap generation is to enable multiple management
     applications in the network to have a consolidated view of the
     whole network of Cisco and non-Cisco devices."
 
     REVISION     "200406070000Z" 
     DESCRIPTION
     "Updated the cenAlarmEntry to include new attributes. The new
     attributes carries information that adds more value to the already
     existing trap structure.
     
     The Management application computes events for a device via 
     polling snmp mib objects on the device and/or by listening to 
     SNMP Traps. Multiple events on a single device roll up into what 
     is called an Alert - there can be only one alert for a given 
     device at any given time. The objects contained in the 
     cenAlarmEntry are the same for both Alert and Event based 
     notification. The attribute cenAlarmMode added in this revision
     of the mib can be used to distinguish between the Alert based and 
     event based notification.
     
     In case of event based notification, the cenAlertID would contain 
     the alert id, as computed by the management system, to which the 
     generated event has been rolled up. 
     
     Traps generated from systems that support mutiple Partition, the 
     cenPartitionNumber and cenPartitionName attributes will carry the
     exact partition details of the device for which the trap is 
     generated.
     
     Through the management application user interface, the user can 
     customize few attributes of the trap structure. Two attributes 
     included in this mib revision that allows the user to customize 
     each trap sent out are cenCustomerIdentification and 
     cenCustomerRevision.
     
     ciscoEpmNotificationObjectsGroup, ciscoEpmNotificationAlarm, and
     ciscoEpmNotificationMIBCompliance have been deprecated in this 
     revision.
     
     ciscoEpmNotificationAlarmRev1,
     ciscoEpmNotificationAlarmGroupRev1,
     ciscoEpmNotificationMIBComplianceRev1, 
     and ciscoEpmNotificationObjectsGroupRev1 have been newly created
     in this revision."
