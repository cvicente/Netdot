         DESCRIPTION
                 "This MIB is to support the Closed RP feature of CDMA
                  PDSN that supports wireless data communication 
                  through 3G CDMA radio access technology.  PDSN acts
                  as a foreign agent that establishes, maintains and
                  terminates the link layer to a mobile station.

                  The high level architecture of a third generation 
                  CDMA2000 network is shown below:

                  The CDMA PDSN CRP MIB provides operational information
                  for a Closed RP implementation.  The following areas 
                  are managed:

                      1) Global PDSN information.  This area contains 
                         generic information such as the number of 
                         incoming call requests, incoming call replies 
                         etc.,

                                    between MS and RN for packet

                    Mobile Station/ A host or router that changes its 
                    Mobile Node     point of attachment from one 
                                    network or subnetwork to another.
                                    A mobile node may change its 
                                    location without changing its
                                    IP address.

                    Mobile IP       Protocol enhancements that allow 
                                    transparent routing of IP datagrams
                                    to mobile nodes.  Refer to RFC 2002
                                    for more details.

                    Mobile Client   A component which can interact with
                                    MoIP entities such as Foreign Agent
                                    and Home Agent.

                    Home Agent      A router on a mobile node's home 
                                    network which tunnels datagrams for 
                                    delivery to the mobile node when it
                                    is away from home, and maintains 
                                    current location information for the
                                    mobile node.  Refer to RFC 2002 for 
                                    more details.

                    Foreign Agent   A router on a mobile node's visited
                                    network which provides routing 
                                    services to the mobile node while 
                                    registered.  The foreign agent 
                                    delivers datagrams to the mobile
                                    node that were tunneled by the 
                                    mobile node's home agent.  For 
                                    datagrams sent by a mobile node, the
                                    foreign agent may serve as a default
                                    router for registered mobile nodes.
                                    Refer to RFC 2002 for more details.

                    Proxy           Mechanism used by PDSN to provide 
                    Mobile Ip       MoIP services to a MS which does
                                    not implement a mobile client.  PDSN
                                    will be the proxy MC for the MS.

                    Simple IP       IP routing used by a MS when MoIP
                                    services are not needed.

                    PDSN flow       A conversation between one user 
                                    (identified by an IP address) and 
                                    a HA using a PDSN session.

                    PDSN session    A PPP connection between a MS and 
                                    the PDSN.  One session may contain 
                                    one or multiple PDSN flows.
