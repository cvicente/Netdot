    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module for the management of the Fibre
        Channel's Registered State Change Notification 
        (RSCN) functionality, which is specified by
        FC-FLA and FC-FS.
        GLOSSARY :
        RSCN    - Registered State Change Notification.
                  RSCN Notifications are sent to Nx_ports
                  and other switches to notify that an event
                  has occured.
        SW_RSCN - Switch Registered State Change Notification.
                  SW_RSCN Notifications are sent to neighbouring
                  switches in a fabric to notify that an
                  event has occured.
         ELS    - Extended Link Service.
                  RSCN Software module uses ELS frame formats 
                  to send RSCN messages.
         ILS    - Inter Link Service.
                  RSCN Software module uses ILS frame formats
                  to send SW-RSCN messages."
