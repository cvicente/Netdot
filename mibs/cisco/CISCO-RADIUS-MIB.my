    DESCRIPTION
        "MIB module for monitoring and configuring
        authentication and logging services using RADIUS
        (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) related 
        objects.

        The RADIUS (RFC2865) framework consists of clients and 
        servers. A client is responsible for passing user 
        information to designated RADIUS servers, and then 
        acting on the response which is returned.

        RADIUS server is responsible for receiving user 
        connection requests, authenticating the user, and then
        returning all configuration information necessary for 
        the client to deliver service to the user.

        This MIB module also contains objects for 
        enabling/disabling telnet and SSH (Secure Shell) 
        authentication. Secure Shell is program which is used 
        to log into another machine over a secured session."
