        DESCRIPTION             
                "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
                devices operating as Central controllers, that
                terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
                tunnel from Cisco Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

                Information provided by this MIB is for CCX related 
                features as specified in the CCX specifications.  
                This MIB covers roaming RF parameters for CCX 
                clients.

                The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
                can be depicted as follows:

                The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
                the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
                the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

                LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
                controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
                that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
                The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
                wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
                the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                                   GLOSSARY

                Access Point ( AP )

                An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
                control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
                and provides access to the distribution services via
                the wireless medium for associated clients.  

                LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
                LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
                it is logically connected.

                Basic Service Set ( BSS )

                The IEEE 802.11 BSS of an AP comprises of the
                stations directly associating with the AP.

                Central Controller ( CC )

                The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol
                tunnel from the LWAPP APs.  Throughout this MIB,
                this entity is also referred to as 'controller'.

                Cisco Compatible eXtensions (CCX)
                
                Wireless LAN Access Points (APs) manufactured by Cisco
                Systems have features and capabilities beyond those in
                related standards (e.g., IEEE 802.11 suite of
                standards ,Wi-Fi recommendations by WECA, 802.1X
                security suite,etc). A number of features provide
                higher performance.For example, Cisco AP transmits a
                specific Information Element, which the clients adapt
                to for enhanced performance. Similarly, a number of
                features are implemented by means of proprietary
                Information Elements, which Cisco clients use in 
                specific ways to carry out tasks above and beyond the
                standard. Other examples of feature categories are
                roaming and power saving.
                
                Client Roaming
                 
                A client may decide to reassociate with another AP for
                reasons of its own choosing. The decision of whether
                or not to use the information contained in the AP list
                is up to the discretion of the implementor, as long as 
                the roam time requirement is met.

                Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) 

                This is a generic protocol that defines the 
                communication between the Access Points and the
                Central Controller.

                Mobile Node ( MN )

                A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
                network associated with an access point. Mobile Node 
                and client are used interchangeably.
