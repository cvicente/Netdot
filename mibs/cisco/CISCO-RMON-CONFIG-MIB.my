    DESCRIPTION
        "This module defines configuration extensions for
        some of the IETF RMON MIBs.

        The following terms are used throughout this MIB:

           A SPAN session is an association of one or more 
           destination(s) with a set of source(s), along with
           other parameters, to specify the network traffic to be
           monitored. Each SPAN session is denoted by an unique
           number.

           The term 'remote SPAN', also called 'RSPAN', refers to 
           the analysis of network traffic remotely, from 
           destination port(s) for one or more source ports, 
           distributed in one or more switches in a switched
           network, through a RSPAN VLAN."

    MAX-ACCESS      read-write
    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This object controls the way the SNMP agent implements the
        getnext operation for tables with a TimeFilter index, such
        as those found in the RMON2-MIB module.

        If this object has the value `stopAfterOne(1)', then a GetNext
        or GetBulk operation will provide one pass through a given 
        table, i.e., the agent will continue to the next object or 
        table, instead of incrementing a TimeMark INDEX value, even if
        there exists higher TimeMark values which are valid for
        the same conceptual row.

        This mode is not strictly compliant with the TimeFilter textual
        convention definition, because potentially many conceptual rows
        will be skipped instead of returned in a GetNext or GetBulk
        operation.  Such rows are identical to each other, except for
        the returned TimeMark INDEX value. This mode is intended only
        for testing purposes, however it may also be useful if an NMS
        wishes to utilize the GetBulk PDU. This mode will prevent the
        GetBulk responses from containing duplicate rows due to the
        TimeFilter mechanism.

        If this object has the value `stopAfterAll(2)', then a getNext
        or getBulk MIB walk will repeat through the same MIB table 
        until the TimeMark for the most-recently changed entry is 
        reached. Note that as long as traffic occurs on the monitored 
        interface, it is possible a highest value of the TimeFilter 
        INDEX may never be reached. This mode is strictly compliant 
        with the TimeFilter textual convention definition.  Note that 
        GetBulk PDU responses in this mode will likely contain multiple
        copies of the same MIB instances, differing only in the 
        TimeMark INDEX value.

        As an example, consider row 'fooEntry' which was last updated
        at 'time 1000'. An NMS may use any TimeMark INDEX value in the
        range '0' to '1000', and the current (i.e., time of get 
        request) counter values for the 'fooEntry' will be returned by
        agent. In the 'stopAfterOne' mode, the agent will not increment
        the fooEntry TimeMark index under any conditions. In the
        'stopAfterAll' mode, the agent will increment any fooEntry
        TimeMark INDEX value in the range '0' to '999', up until
        the TimeMark value of '1000' is reached."

    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "Describes a particular port copy extension entry.

        When creating an entry in this table using the 'createAndwait'
        method, the following rules are applied:

        - no SPAN consistency check is done for the entry until
        the entry is activated.  An entry will not be activated
        if it fails the SPAN consistency check described for
        the 'createAndGo' method.

        -an instance remains in the 'notReady' state until the
        associated portCopyStatus changes to 'active'.

        When the agent processes a request of adding an entry
        using 'createAndGo' method or a request that sets the value
        of portCopyStatus object to 'active', the following rules
        are applied:

        The agent will add the entry to a SPAN session having the same
        portCopySessionNo, or create a new session if it does not
        exist. To join an existing session, either portCopySource or
        portCopyDest, but not both, must exist in one of the entries
        from the same SPAN session. In addition, the following actions
        will be taken after a successful join:

        1. The portCopyDirection, portCopyLoVlanMask, and
           portCopyHiVlanMask values will overwrite the existing
           values associated with this port copy session.

        2. The portCopyDestLoVlanMask, portCopyDestHiVlanMask, and
           portCopyOption values will overwrite the existing values
           associated the same portCopyDest and this port copy session.

        3. If the value of portCopyDest object does not exist in the
           existing SPAN session, each of the ports identified in the
           portCopySource is added to this SPAN session. 
           For example, given an existing SPAN session having ports 
           1, 2, and 3 as source ports, and port A as the destination
           port, if an entry is added by an NMS with indices of (2,B),
           the agent will also add entries for the other source ports
           (e.g. (1,B) and (3,B)) to the session.  The same algorithm
           for adding entries will be applied if the portCopySource
           does not already belong to this SPAN session.

        When the agent processes a request to change the RowStatus of
        an entry from 'active' to 'notInService', the following
        rules are applied:

        - That entry will be removed from its participating SPAN 
        session. The new RowStatus state will be 'notInService'.

        - all entries in the table that have the same value of
        portCopySessionNo and same value of portCopySource are
        also set to 'NotInService'.

        When agent processes a request to delete an entry, the
        following rules are applied:

        - the entry is simply removed if it is not currently active.

        - if the portCopySessionNo value is non-zero and the value of
        portCopyRemoveSrc object is set to 'true', then all entries 
        with the same value of portCopySessionNo and same value of 
        portCopySource are deleted.

        - if the portCopySessionNo value is non-zero and the value of
        portCopyRemoveSrc object is set to 'false', then all entries
        with the same value of portCopySessionNo and same
        value of portCopyDest are deleted.

        - if the last portCopy entry is removed from a session, 
        then the session information is also removed."

        "This object affects the way VLAN-based traffic is copied from

        It is used in tandem with the portCopyHiVlanMask to

        This object is used to select or deselect VLAN IDs 
        0 though 2047. 

        If this object contains a zero-length string, or none 
        of the octets contain a non-zero value, and the 
        associated portCopyHiVlanMask is not instantiated, 
        contains a zero-length string, or contains only 
        zero-valued octets, then network traffic will not 
        be filtered, based on IEEE 802.1Q or ISL VLAN ID, before 
        it is copied to the indicated destination port. 

        If this object has a non-zero length, and at least 
        one octet contains a non-zero value, or the 
        portCopyHiVlanMask contains at least one non-zero octet, 
        then traffic will be filtered, based on the indicated 
        IEEE 802.1Q or ISL VLAN ID, before it is copied to the 
        indicated destination port. Only frames (tagged or 
        untagged) which match the indicated VLAN ID(s) will be 
        copied to the indicated destination port. 

        VLAN IDs are encoded as a string of octets containing 
        one bit per VLAN to be included in the port copy operation. 
        The first octet corresponds to VLANs with VlanIndex values 
        of 0 through 7; the second octet to VLANs 8 through 15; etc. 
        The most significant bit of each octet corresponds to the 
        lowest value VlanIndex in that octet.  If the bit 
        corresponding to a VLAN is set to '1', then the traffic 
        associated with that VLAN will be selected for the 
        indicated port copy operation. 

        Note that if the length of this string is less than 
        256 octets, any 'missing' octets are assumed to contain 
        the value zero. An NMS may omit any zero-valued octets 
        from the end of this string in order to reduce SetPDU size, 
        and the agent may also omit zero-valued trailing octets, 
        to reduce the size of GetResponse PDUs. 

        The creation and deletion of instances of this object is 
        controlled by the portCopyStatus object found in the

        then traffic will be filtered, based on the indicated 
        IEEE 802.1Q or ISL VLAN ID, before it is copied to the 
        indicated destination port. Only frames (tagged or 
        untagged) which match the indicated VLAN ID(s) will be 
        copied to the indicated destination port. If a VLAN is
        included in the portCopyDestLoVlanMask object, it should 
        also be included in the portCopyLoVlanMask object and 
        vice versa.

        VLAN IDs are encoded as a string of octets containing 
        one bit per VLAN to be included in the port copy operation. 
        The first octet corresponds to VLANs with VlanIndex values 
        of 0 through 7; the second octet to VLANs 8 through 15; etc. 
        The most significant bit of each octet corresponds to the 
        lowest value VlanIndex in that octet.  If the bit 
        corresponding to a VLAN is set to '1', then the traffic 
        associated with that VLAN will be selected for the 
        indicated port copy operation. 

        Note that if the length of this string is less than 
        256 octets, any 'missing' octets are assumed to contain 
        the value zero. An NMS may omit any zero-valued octets 
        from the end of this string in order to reduce SetPDU size, 
        and the agent may also omit zero-valued trailing octets, 
        to reduce the size of GetResponse PDUs. 

        The creation and deletion of instances of this object is 
        controlled by the portCopyStatus object found in the 
        augmented portCopyEntry.  It is an implementation-specific

        "This object affects the way VLAN-based traffic to a switch
        destination port is filtered for the indicated port copy 
        operation. It is used in tandem with the 
        portCopyDestLoVlanMask to identify all possible 4096 IEEE 
        802.1Q VLAN ID values. This object is used to select or 
        deselect VLAN IDs 2048 though 4095. 

        If this object contains a zero-length string, or none 
        of the octets contain a non-zero value, and the 
        associated portCopyDestLoVlanMask is not instantiated, 
        contains a zero-length string, or contains only 
        zero-valued octets, then network traffic will not 
        be filtered, based on IEEE 802.1Q or ISL VLAN ID, before 
        it is copied to the indicated destination port. 

        If this object has a non-zero length, and at least 
        one octet contains a non-zero value, or the 
        portCopyDestLoVlanMask contains at least one non-zero octet,

        indicated destination port. Only frames (tagged or 
        untagged) which match the indicated VLAN ID(s) will be 
        copied to the indicated destination port. If a VLAN is
        included in the portCopyDestHiVlanMask object, it should
        also be included in the portCopyHiVlanMask object and
        vice versa.

        VLAN IDs are encoded as a string of octets containing 
        one bit per VLAN to be included in the port copy operation. 
        The first octet corresponds to VLANs with VlanIndex values 
        of 2048 through 2055; the second octet to VLANs 2056 through 
        2063; etc. The most significant bit of each octet corresponds 
        to the lowest value VlanIndex in that octet.  If the bit 
        corresponding to a VLAN is set to '1', then the traffic 
        associated with that VLAN will be selected for the 
        indicated port copy operation. 

        Note that if the length of this string is less than

        VLAN IDs are encoded as a string of octets containing
        one bit per VLAN to be included in the port copy operation.
        The first octet corresponds to VLANs with VlanIndex values

        If this object has the value 'false', then the probe
        will attempt to monitor all packets detected on the 
        indicated interface, in the event any RMON collections are
        actually configured.  The data returned in all RMON collection
        tables associated with this interface will represent 
        non-sampled monitored counter values. 

        If this object has the value 'true', then the 
        probe will use adaptive statistical sampling techniques to 
        monitor the indicated interface, in the event any RMON 
        collections are actually configured.  The data returned
        in RMON collection tables associated with this interface
        may be based on statistical approximations. In this mode, the 
        RMON agent will also maintain additional MIB objects to provide
        the confidence interval information for each sampled counter. 
        These objects can be found in the CISCO-RMON-SAMPLING-MIB.

        When this object transitions from 'false' to 'true', 
        all active packet capture functions will be suspended,
        without affecting the contents of any associated 
        filterEntry, filter2Entry, channelEntry, channel2Entry,
        bufferControlEntry, captureBufferEntry, or
        captureBufferHighCapacityEntry. Only the low-level packet 
        capture processing is deactivated.

        When this object transitions from 'true' to 'false',
        all suspended packet capture functions associated
        with the interface will be reactivated. 

        Note that an NMS application which is unaware of this MIB 
        object will not be able to detect suspended packet capture 
        operations or sampled collections, however multi-manager 
        mis-configuration issues are beyond the scope of this MIB. 
        The packet capture function Get and Set operations are
        not affected by this object.

        If an interface cannot be sampled, or the sampling 
        configuration cannot be modified, then such an instance
        of this object will be implemented with read-only access."
