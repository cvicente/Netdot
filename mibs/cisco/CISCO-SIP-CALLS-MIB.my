        DESCRIPTION
            "The Cisco Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Calls MIB
            module is designed to provide protocol-specific
            information on SIP calls which are currently active.
            SIP is an application-layer signalling protocol for
            creating, modifying and terminating multimedia
            sessions with one or more participants. SIP is defined
            in RFC 3261 (June 2002).
            The endpoints in a SIP communication are called user 
            agents. A user agent is an application which contains
            both a User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server
            (UAS). A UAC is an application that initiates a SIP
            request. A UAS is an application that contacts the
            user when a SIP request is received and that returns
            a response on behalf of the user. This MIB module
            provides information on SIP calls and the user agents
            initiating these calls. Also, it provides a way to
            manage media forking of SIP calls."
