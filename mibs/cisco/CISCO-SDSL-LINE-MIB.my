    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module describes all variations of the symmetric 
        DSL line interfaces.  The structure of this module resembles 
        and maintains consistency with the ADSL-LINE-MIB, 
        ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB, CISCO-ADSL-DMT-LINE-MIB, and 
        CISCO-ADSL-CAP-LINE-MIB. Observe that the tables in this 
        module do not necessarily extend the tables defined by the
        these mibs. Currently, only those tables that contain 
        configuration information extend the profile tables defined 
        by the above modules.  This allows the management
        client to define DSL configuration profiles that apply across
        all DSL modems, independent of the technology being utilized by
        the modem.

        *** DEFINITIONS ***

	ATTENUATION
	  Attenuation is a decrease in the strength of a signal 
	  over the length of a cable.

        CODING VIOLATION
            A coding violation occurs when the incoming signal exhibits
            a CRC anomaly.

        DOWNSTREAM
            The flow of data in the direction from the ATU-C to ATU-R.
                      
        ERRORED SECOND
            A second with one or more coding violations or one or more
            incoming defects (e.g., LOS or LOSQ).

        LINE RATE
            The total data rate supported by a line.  Observe that the
            payload rate is equal the line rate for the earliest
            implementations of SDSL.  However, the payload rate maybe
            less than the line rate for future implementations.

        LOSS OF SYNC DEFECT
            A Loss of Sync Defect is defined as 3 consecutive received 
            frames which contain one or more errors in the framing
            bits. A Loss of Sync Defect shall be cleared when at least 
            2 consecutive received frames contain no errors in the
            framing bits.

        LOSS OF SYNC FAILURE 
             A LOSW Failure is defined as at least 2 consecutive
             seconds of LOSW Defect.  The LOSW Failure should be
             cleared when the LOSW defect is absent for 20 seconds or
             less. (i.e. clear within 20 seconds ).

        MARGIN (also referred to as 'SNR margin')
            The difference between the SNR of the received signal and
            the SNR required to provide a BER of 10E-7.

        SEVERELY ERRORED SECOND
            A one second interval during which or more LOSW or CV defects
            are declared. 

        UNAVAILABLE SECOND
            A Unavailable Second is defined as a one second interval
            during which LOSW Failure ( at least 2 seconds of LOSW
            Defect ).

        UPSTREAM
            The flow of data in the direction from the ATU-R to ATU-C.

        *** ABBREVIATIONS, ACRONYMS, AND SYMBOLS ***

SdslPerfTimeElapsed ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "The number of seconds that have elapsed since the beginning of
        the current measurement period.  If, for some reason, such as an
        adjustment in the system's time-of-day clock, the current
        interval exceeds the maximum value, the agent will return the
        maximum value."
    SYNTAX Gauge32

SdslPerfCurrDayCount ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A counter associated with interval performance measurements in
        a current 1-day (24 hour) measurement interval.

        The value of this counter starts at zero at the beginning of an
        interval and increases when associated events occur, until the
        end of the 1-day interval.  At that time, the agent stores the
        value of the counter in the previous 1-day history interval,
        if available, and resets the value of the counter to zero.

        In the case where the agent has no valid data available for this
        interval, the corresponding object instance is not available.
        In this case, the agent will respond with the appropriate error
        indicating that the instance does not exist; that is,
        'noSuchName' in response to a SNMPv1 get request, and
        'noSuchInstance' in response to a SNMPv2 get request."
    SYNTAX Gauge32

SdslPerfPrevDayCount ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION
        "A counter associated with interval performance measurements
        during the most previous 1-day (24 hour) measurement interval.
        The value of this counter is equal to the current day counter
        at the end of its most recent interval.

        In the case where the agent has no valid data available for this
        interval, the corresponding object instance is not available.
        In this case, the agent will respond with the appropriate error
        indicating that the instance does not exist; that is,
