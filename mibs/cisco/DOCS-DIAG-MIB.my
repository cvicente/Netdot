        DESCRIPTION
            "This is the MIB Module for the Diagnostic Log for
            DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS). 

            The purpose of the Diagnostic Log is to prevent service
            interruptions by early detection of potential problems.
            It can also be used for fault management and for
            troubleshooting the cable network.

            The Diagnostic Log contains Cable Modems that show certain
            potential problematic behaviors, as determined by the CMTS.
            These detection criteria are defined as diagnostictriggers. 

            The diagnostic trigger is an information filter to avoid
            inundating a management agent with data which is less
            meaningful as a function of size. 

            There are 2 diagnostic triggers defined. Each trigger
            maintains a counter for each Cable Modem that is caught
            by that trigger. 

            (1) Registration Trigger 

            (2) Ranging Retry Trigger
