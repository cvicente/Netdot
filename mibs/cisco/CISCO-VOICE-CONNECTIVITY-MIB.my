                "This MIB module provides connectivity related
                information for devices (e.g., 'connectivity between 
                voice gateway, phones, gatekeepers and call processing 
                agent').  The MIB can be used by network management 
                applications to collect the information regarding voice 
                connectivity among the devices in the network.  The MIB 
                can also be used to retrieve the status of voice 
                connectivity between the devices.

                CALL AGENT
                A call processing agent component of a device in IP 
                telephony and VoIP network.
                
                PORT
                A port on the device that is associated with call 
                processing agent.
                
                REGISTRATION
                In an IP telephony network, there are typically keep-
                alive messages or expected registration refresh timers
                that are used to formulate the registration status of 
                devices and/or users.  
                Possible values of the registration status are as 
                follows:
                registered:   The port has successfully registered with
                              the call agent
        
                unregistered: The port is no longer registered with the
                              call agent
            
                rejected:     Registration request from the port was 
                              rejected by the call agent."
