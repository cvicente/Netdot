        DESCRIPTION
            "This is the MIB module for the support of Channel Bonding
            Protocol for the Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS).

            Wideband DOCSIS is a method of increasing downstream 
            bandwidth by simultaneously transmitting DOCSIS data 
            over multiple RF channels. This DOCSIS data is 
            organized as a sequence of 188-byte MPEG-TS data packets. 

            A Wideband CMTS (WCMTS) is a CMTS that also transmits 
            Wideband MPEG-TS packets.

            An Edge QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) device is one 
            which provides the QAM and used to couple the Wideband MPEG-TS 
            packet onto the HFC plant. 

            A Wideband Cable Modem (WCM) is a CableModem (CM) that 
            is able to receive Wideband MPEG-TS packets.

            A wideband channel or Bonded Group (BG) is a logical 
            grouping of one or more physical RF channels over which 
            MPEG-TS packets are carried. Wideband channel carries DOCSIS 
            bonded packets encapsulated in MPEG-TS packets from a 
            WCMTS to one or more WCMs. 

            Packets outgoing from WCMTS to the WCM are formatted with 
            the DOCSIS Header. The DOCSIS packets are then formatted into 
            MPEG-TS data packets. These are 188 byte MPEG packets 
            containing the DOCSIS information. 
            Within DOCSIS Header of the WB Channel there is an extended 
            header called, DOCSIS Bonding Extended Header, the format of
            which is shown below:

             --------------------------------------------------------
            |  ----------------------------------------------------  |
            | |  TYPE | LEN |       BSID           |      SEQ        |
            |  ----------------------------------------------------  |
            | |    byte 0   |     byte 1-2         |    byte 3-4     |
            |--------------------------------------------------------|
                          DOCSIS Bonding Extended Header

            BSID is the Bonding Service IDentifier, it defines a sequence 
            number for a Wideband channel. It is used by the WCM to 
            re-sequence packets received over downstream channels to 
            maintain packet order. SEQ is per service flow sequence number. 
            Whereas TYPE is the type of the Bonding Extended Header and LEN
            specifies its length.

            A Narrowband Channel is a standard DOCSIS downstream channel 
            which contains exactly one RF channel.   
            The wideband protocol utilizes the existing narrowband 
            downstream channel for carrying the MAC management and 
            signaling messages and the associated narrowband upstream 
            for return data traffic and signaling.  

            The channel bonding protocol supports multiple wideband 
            bonded groups. This will allow the WCM to listen to multiple 
            bonded groups at the same time. This would support (for example) 
            multicast video being sent to a CPE device on the LAN side of 
            the WCM in addition to standard DOCSIS data.

            Channel Bonding allows two types of Bonding Group (BG) interfaces.
            These are Secondary BG interface and non-Secondary BG
            interface. The Secondary BG interfaces will carry the multicast
            traffic, whereas, the non-Secondary BG interface will carry the
            non-multicast traffic.
            This MIB also allows for configuration of the RF channels 
            on the WCMTS, as well as the association between the RF and 
            narrowband downstream channels with the BG channel.

            Fiber Node is an optical node which terminates the fiber based
            downstream signal as an electrical signal onto a coaxial RF cable."
