        DESCRIPTION
            "This is the MIB Module for Cable Spectrum Management for
             DOCSIS-compliant Cable Modem Termination Systems (CMTS).

             Spectrum management is a software/hardware feature provided
             in the CMTS so that the CMTS may sense both downstream and
             upstream plant impairments, report them to a management
             entity, and automatically mitigate them where possible.

             The CMTS directly senses upstream transmission errors.It
             may also indirectly monitor the condition of the plant by
             keeping a record of modem state changes.  It is desireable
             to perform these functions without reducing throughput or
             latency and without creating additional packet overhead on
             the RF plant.

             The purpose of cable Spectrum Management is to prevent long
             term service interruptions caused by upstream noise events
             in the cable plant.  It is also used for fault management
             and trouble shooting the cable network.  When modems are
             detected to go on-line and off-line by flap detectors, the
             cable operators can look at the flap list and spectrum
             tables to determine the possible causes."

--
-- Flap List Group
--
-- CMTS maintains a list of polled cable modems, when a polled cable
-- modem triggers a flap detector the modem is considered intermittent
-- and is added into the Flap List.
--
-- The flap detector is an information filter to avoid inundating a 
-- management agent with data which is less meaningful as a function of 
-- size.  
--
-- There are 3 flap detectors defined.  The flap count (ccsFlapTotal)
-- will be incremented when any one of the flap detectors is triggered.
--
-- (1) Registration Flap:
--     A CM may fail the registration process due to not being able
--     to get an IP address.  When that happens the CMTS will receive 
--     the Initial Maintenance packet from the CM sooner than expected 
--     and the CM is considered a flapping modem.  In addition to the 
--     flap count ccsFlapInsertionFails will be incremented; thus 
--     these two counters may tend to track each other for 
--     unauthorized modems.  Another cause of registration flap may 
--     be downstream loss of sync or upstream ranging failure.
--
-- (2) Station Maintenance Flap:
--     When the CMTS receives a Miss followed by a Hit then the modem
--     will be added into the Flap List and the flap count will be
--     incremented.
--     If ratio of Miss/Hit is high, then an upstream impairment is
--     indicated.
--
-- (3) Power Adjustment Flap:
--     When the CM upstream transmit power is adjusted and the
--     adjustment is greater than the threshold
--     (ccsPowerAdjustThreshold), the modem will be added into the Flap
--     List.  In addition to the flap count ccsFlapPowerAdjustCnt will
--     be incremented.  Excessive power adjustment is an indication of
--     poor or failing plant components.  It may also
--     indicate the exposure of plant components to the forces of wind,
--     moisture, or temperature.
