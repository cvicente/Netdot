        DESCRIPTION
                "This module defines textual conventions used
                throughout the Cisco enterprise MIBs
                designed for implementation on Central 
                Controllers that terminate the Light Weight
                Access Point Protocol from LWAPP Access
                Points. 

                The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
                can be depicted as follows:

                The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
                the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
                the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

                LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
                controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
                that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
                The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
                wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
                the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                                GLOSSARY

                Access Point ( AP )

                An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
                control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
                and provides access to the distribution services via
                the wireless medium for associated clients.

                LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
                LWAPP frames and sends it to the controller to which
                it is logically connected.

                Advanced Encryption Standard ( AES )

                In cryptography, the Advanced Encryption Standard
                (AES), also known as Rijndael, is a block cipher
                adopted as an encryption standard by the US
                government. It is expected to be used worldwide
                and analysed extensively, as was the case with its
                predecessor, the Data Encryption Standard (DES).
                AES was adopted by National Institute of Standards
                and Technology (NIST) as US FIPS PUB 197 in
                November 2001 after a 5-year standardisation
                process.
         
                Central Controller ( CC )

                The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol
                tunnel from the LWAPP APs.  Throughout this MIB,
                this entity is also referred to as 'controller'.

                Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP )

                This is a generic protocol that defines the
                communication between the Access Points and the
                Central Controller. 

                Management Frame Protection ( MFP )

                A proprietary mechanism devised to integrity protect
                the otherwise unprotected management frames of the
                802.11 protocol specification.

                Message Integrity Check ( MIC )

                A checksum computed on a sequence of bytes and made
                known to the receiving party in a data communication,
                to let the receiving party make sure the bytes
                received were not compromised enroute.

                Mobile Node ( MN )

                A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
                network associated with an access point.

                Temporal Key Integrity Protocol ( TKIP )

                A security protocol defined to enhance the limitations
                of WEP.  Message Integrity Check and per-packet keying
                on all WEP-encrypted frames are two significant
                enhancements provided by TKIP to WEP.

                Wired Equivalent Privacy ( WEP )

                A security method defined by 802.11. WEP uses a
                symmetric key stream cipher called RC4 to encrypt the
                data packets.
