    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB module is for Access Control Lists(ACLs) configuration
        of Quality of Service (QoS) as well as Security feature on the
        Cisco Catalyst 5000/6000 series switch running CatOS. It also
        provides QoS configuration and statistics information.
         
        Configuration information available through this MIB includes
        Security and QoS ACL configuration for IP, IPX and Layer 2 
        traffic, QoS and Security configuration parameters. 

        Statistics available through this MIB includes QoS statistics
        for Layer 3 traffic. In addition, detailed, flow-specific
        statistics are also available.

        This MIB module is applied in conjunction with 
        CISCO-QOS-POLICY-CONFIG-MIB. The configuration information 
        available through this MIB takes effect throughout the device 
        when the value of qosPrOperPolicySource object in 
        CISCO-QOS-POLICY-CONFIG-MIB is 'local' or applies to a specific
        interface when the value of qosPrIfOperPolicySource object
        in CISCO-QOS-POLICY-CONFIG-MIB which associates with that 
        interface is 'local' while the value of qosPrOperPolicySource is
        not 'local'.

        The following terms are used throughout this MIB: 

            ACE stands for Access Control Entry. An ACL consists of an 
            ordered set of ACEs. ACE is a filter which is used to 
            identify flows with certain characteristics. It includes
            fields such as ingress/egress ports, L2(layer 2) addresses,
            L3(layer 3) addresses, TCP/UDP port numbers, etc.

            QoS ACE and Security ACE are very similar to each other
            but the actions of the ACEs are different.  
       
            Security ACEs are compared to each packet, and each ACE
            specifies whether packets that match with it are either
            forwarded or dropped.

            ESP: Enscrypted Security Payload.
 
            QoS is the method which attempts to ensure that the network
            requirements of different applications can be met by giving
            preferential forwarding treatment to some traffic. It is
            usually consisted of these steps: classification, policing,
            output scheduling, marking and shaping. Classification 
            identifies the traffic. Policing checks if the traffic 
            conformed to a specified criteria. Output scheduling,
            marking and shaping control how the traffic is transmitted
            to the next hop. 

            A flow is a non-specific term for a microflow or an
            aggregate flow.

            Microflow is a single instance of an application to 
            application flow of packets which is identified by source
            address, source port, destination address, destination port
            and protocol id.

            Aggregate flow is a collection of microflows that are
            treated together as one for the purpose of QoS.

            DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) is the six most 
            significant bits of the ToS field in a IP packet header.

            DSCP Mutation: the previous hop(s) and the following hop(s)
            of a device may reside in a different QoS domain. A QoS
            domain refers to the set of QoS rules and conventions
            adopted by an administrative entity. For instance, a set
            of DSCP values may have a different meaning in different
            domains. DSCP mutation allows a DSCP set to be mutated or
            transformed in order to maintain semantic compatibility
            between adjacent domains. The mutation is done via mapping
            tables which maps the old DSCP value from one domain to a
            new DSCP value in the other domain. 

            IP precedence is the three most significant bits of the ToS 
            field in a IP packet header.
            
            Cos (Class of Service) is the three bits in the layer 2
            header that indicates user priority value assigned to this
            packet.

            Trust state is a parameter configured at a physical
            interface or an ACL to determine a DSCP value assigned to
            a packet for QoS purpose.

            In profile packet is a packet that does not cause the
            committed access rate of the packet's flow to be exceeded.

            Out of profile packet is a packet that cause the committed
            access rate of the packet's flow to be exceeded.

        To accomplish classification, the user defines an ACL describing
        the specification of a traffic flow then attaches this ACL to a 
        physical interface or a vlan. When a packet arrives at an
        interface, depending on the configured trust state at that
        interface, it can either be matched against an ACL if the trust
        state is not trusted or get a DSCP assigned and go directly to 
        output scheduling. In the former case, when the packet matches 
        an ACE in the attached ACL, the next step will be policing. At 
        the end of classification process, a packet has a DSCP value 
        assigned. In some platform (e.g. Catalyst 4000) that does not
        support ACL configuration, classification is accomplished by
        matching the Cos value of incoming packet. 

        A packet can be policed at microflow or aggregate flow level.
        Policing is done using the token bucket algorithm. 
        At the end of policing process, if packet does not cause the
        flow to exceed the normal rate, it will continue to the next
        step. Otherwise, the packet is dropped or assigned a 'policed'
        DSCP value. Some platforms support multi-rate policing.  When 
        packet causes the flow to exceed the normal rate but not the
        excess rate, it is assigned a 'policed' DSCP value. When packet
        causes the flow to exceed excess rate, it is either dropped or
        has a 'policed' DSCP value assigned. After policing process,
        the next step is output scheduling.

        Output scheduling is the process of assigning a packet to
        a queue and a threshold according to the packet's Cos value.
        To get its Cos value, a DSCP to Cos mapping will be performed.

        This MIB also defines 'Security ACLs' which some devices support
        as a mean to enforce security. Security ACLs, attached at an
        ingress interface, are compared to each packet arriving at that
        interface. If the packet matches an ACE in the ACLs, it is
        either permitted to go through the device or blocked and
        dropped or redirected to another interface."

        this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first
        octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet
        specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the
        most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port,
        and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered
        port. Thus, each port is represented by a single bit within
        the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1' then
        that port is included in the set of redirect ports; the port
        is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. The value of
        this object is ignored whenever the value of caqSecurityAction
        object in the same row is not redirect(3). This object can
        accommodate up to 2048 ports.
     
        A port number is the value of dot1dBasePort for the port in
        the BRIDGE-MIB (RFC 1493)."
