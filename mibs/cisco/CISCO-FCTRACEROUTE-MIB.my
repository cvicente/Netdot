        DESCRIPTION
                "A trace route request entry.

                 A management station wishing to create an entry
                 should generate a pseudo-random number to be 
                 used as an index into this table and create an 
                 instance of the fcTraceRouteRowStatus object. 
                 After that, the management station should set 
                 the corresponding instance of fcTraceRouteTargetAddr 
                 object with the address of the destination for which 
                 the route needs to be determined and 
                 fcTraceRouteVsanIndex with the desired VSAN number.

                 Once the appropriate instance of all the 
                 configuration objects have been created, either by 
                 an explicit SNMP set request or by default, the row 
                 status should be set to active and the corresponding 
                 instance of fcTraceRouteAdminStatus should be set to 
                 'enable' to initiate the trace route sequence. Note 
                 that this entire procedure may be initiated via a 
                 single set request which specifies a row status of 
                 createAndGo as well as specifies valid values for 
                 the non-defaulted configuration objects.

                 The results of the trace route operation are made
                 available in the fcTraceRouteHopsTable. For an entry 
                 uniquely identified by fcTraceRouteIndex, the value
                 of the corresponding instance of 
                 fcTraceRouteOperStatus object will specify whether 
                 test was a success or a failure.

                 The fcTraceRouteHopsTable will contain the actual
                 hops that were determined by the test.
                 For an entry uniquely identified by 
                 fcTraceRouteIndex, entries will be created 
                 automatically in the fcTraceRouteHopsTable which 
                 contain the different hops of the trace route path.


                 Once the trace route test is complete, the management
                 station should retrieve the information from the
                 fcTraceRouteHopsTable and delete the entry from this 
                 table. When an entry is deleted from this table, 
                 related entries in the fcTraceRouteHopsTable will be 
                 automatically deleted by the agent.

                 In order to prevent old entries from clogging the 
                 table, entries will be aged out. But an entry will 
                 never be deleted within fcTraceRouteAgeInterval 
                 milliseconds of completing.

                 If the management station wishes to repeat the trace
                 route test for a particular destination, then it will
                 need to set the corresponding instance of 
                 fcTraceRouteAdminStatus to 'enable' again."
