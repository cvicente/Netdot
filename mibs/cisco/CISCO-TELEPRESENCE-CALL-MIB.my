    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module defines the managed objects for
        Telepresence calls.

        Telepresence refers to a set of technologies which 
        allow a person to feel as if they were present, to give 
        the appearance that they were present, or to have an 
        effect, at a location other than their true location.

        Telepresence call is an audio-video call; however, some 
        Telepresence systems also support audio addin call.

        Different security levels are supported in some Telepresence
        systems; security level may be specified from call management 
        system.

        Some Telepresence systems support Telepresence meeting, the 
        agent of the corresponding systems may also support
        CISCO-TELEPRESENCE-MEETING-MIB."

        call.

        Some Telepresence systems support both audio-video call and
        audio-addin call. 

        A management station wishing to create a call should create
        the associated instance of the row status and the remote 
        directory number objects.  ctpcIndex should be set to the 
        next-to-be-assigned number of ctpcTableLastIndex.

        An instance of ctpcRemoteDirNum is required to create
        a call.

        Once the appropriate instance of all the configuration
        objects have been created, the row status should be set
        to active to initiate the request. Note that this entire
        procedure may be initiated via a single set request which
        specifies a row status of createAndGo.

        Once a call entry has been activated, it cannot be stopped.

        Instance of ctpcState on the created row reports the
        latest status of the newly created call.

        If a Telepresence system receives a call, a unique index will 
        be chosen and an entry will be created by the agent,
        ctpcRowStatus will be set to active, and
        ctpcRemoteDirNum will be filled by agent if it is known."
