    DESCRIPTION
        "The main purpose of this MIB is to define the SNMP
        notifications and alarms generated by Session Border Controller
        application and used to send these notifications to SNMP
        manager application. Each of these event/notification is
        explained in detail in the MIB file.

        The SBC service is implemented on a service card on CISCO
        routers. SBC application offer functionalities like
        firewall/NAT traversal, media bridging, policy-based call
        routing, signaling protocol inter-working, call billing and
        some degree of Call Admission Control. SBC looks to play an
        essential role in full-scale commercial deployment of VoIP and
        integration into the existing PSTN. 
        The Session Border Controller (SBC) enables direct IP-to-IP
        interconnect between multiple administrative domains for
        session-based services providing protocol inter-working,
        security, and admission control and management. The SBC is a
        voice over IP (VoIP) device that sits on the border
        of a network and controls call admission to that network.

        The primary purpose of an SBC is to protect the interior of 
        the network from excessive call load and malicious traffic.
        Additional functions provided by the SBC include media 
        bridging and billing services. 

        Various types of notifications required for SBC applications
        are
        as follows:
        1. When SIP/H2.48 calls are established and SBC application
        receives traffic (RTP/RTCP packets) from a source whose IP
        address or port is ambiguous, a source alert event is generated
        for the unwanted data packets received by SBC application.

        2. Blacklisting is the process of matching inbound packets based
        on some simple parameters (for example source IP address) and
        preventing packets that match those parameters from being
        processed. SBC detects an attempt to disrupt traffic flowing
        through it. When a source is blacklisted in SBC application, an
        event is generated to provide information of the blacklisted
        source like its IP address, port, VPN address etc.

        3. When there is a change in the state of any SBC service
        configured like a new SBC service is configured or the SBC card
        goes to standby state, reboot or offline state, a service is
        removed from SBC card, an event is generated by SBC.

        4. When a large number of SIP/H.248 calls are ongoing and 
        system is congested i.e. high CPU usage or high use of memory
        utilization, congestion event is generated at this point and
        when congestion is cleared means CPU usage comes to normal
        another event for congestion clear is generated.

        5. When a service is configured on SBC application, its call
        policies are defined during the configuration like maximum
        number of calls, maximum call rates etc. If any of these
        policies is violated, an event for violation of service level
        agreement is generated.

        6. When a radius server is attached/detached with SBC, a
        notification is generated to provide information of radius
        server type, IP address, port etc.

        7. When an adjacency is attached/detached with SBC, a
        notification is generated to provide its information like the
        adjacency type and state.

        8. When a H.248 controller is attached/detached with SBC to
        establish H.248 calls with SBC, a notification is generated to
        provide the information regarding the attached/detached H.248
        controller like controller index, IP address, port, state etc.

        GLOSSARY
        SBC: Session Border Controller

        CSB: CISCO Session Border Controller

        CAC: Call Admission Control - protects voice traffic from the
        negative effects of other voice traffic and to keep excess voice
        traffic off the network. It is used to prevent congestion in
        Voice traffic. It is used in the Call Setup phase.

        RTP: Real Time Transport Protocol - defines a standardized
        packet format for delivering audio and video over the Internet.

        RTCP: Real Time Control Protocol - It is a sister protocol of
        the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). RTCP provides
        out-of-band control information for an RTP flow. It partners RTP
        in the delivery and packaging of multimedia data, but does not
        transport any data itself. It is used periodically to transmit
        control packets to participants in a streaming multimedia
        session.

        VMG: Virtual Media Gateway - introduced to bridge between
        different transmission technologies and to add service to
        end-user connections. Its architecture separates control and
        connectivity functions into physically separate network layers.
        VPN: Virtual Private Network - It is a communications network
        tunneled through another network, and dedicated for a specific
        network.

        Gate Id - Context Identifiers assigned uniquely to a SIP/H.248
        call flows.

        Flow Pair Id: Stream Identifiers assigned uniquely to a
        SIP/H.248 call flows.

        Adjacency: An adjacency contains the system information to be
        transmitted to next HOP.

        SLA: Service Level Agreement - Service level agreement includes
        some call admission control policies which are defined during
        the SBC configurations like maximum number of calls, maximum
        call rates etc.

        Diameter Server: A Diameter Server is one that handles
        authentication, authorization and accounting requests for a
        particular realm.
