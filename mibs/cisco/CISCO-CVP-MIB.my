    DESCRIPTION
        "The Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) application
        integrates with both traditional time-division multiplexing
        (TDM) and IP-based contact centers to provide an unparalleled
        call management and call treatment solution with a self-
        service, speech-enabled Interactive Voice Rresponse (IVR)
        option that can use information available to customers on the
        corporate Web server.

        With support for automated speech recognition (ASR) and text-
        to-speech (TTS) capabilities, callers can obtain personalized
        answers to increasingly complex questions and can conduct
        business in new and innovative ways ?- all without the costs
        of interacting with a live agent.

        CVP is a distributed, self-service IVR application.  The
        solution is comprised of a set of distinct services: each
        performs a specific function.  The services are loosely
        coupled, which aides its distributed nature, and yet they are
        tightly integrated.  Each service provides a core function
        and is dependent upon the other services to perform that
        function.

        A single CVP server may have one or more services installed
        on a single server: even in the smallest deployment scenarios,
        there will be at least two servers -- a call server and a
        Voice XML (VXML) server.  The call server, whether it is a
        single physical server or a virtual set of servers, will
        include the SIP service, the IVR service and in many cases,
        the ICM service.  Environments desiring the use of the H.323
        protocol will have the H.323 service either exclusively or in
        concert with the SIP service available on the call server.
        The server providing VXML services will have the VXML server
        (which executes the IVR scripts, plays prompts and collects
        digits) and the VXML service which provides the interface
        between the other CVP services and the VXML server.  A
        reporting server houses a database management system and the
        CVP reporting service which receives events from other CVP
        services and writes data to the database.  The number of
        servers that are part of the solution will scale to the
        expected capacity for that deployment.

        For many deployments, CVP works in concert with the Cisco
        Unified Intelligent Contact Management (ICM) Enterprise and/or
        the Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise contact management
        systems.  In this deployment scenario, CVP acts as a self-
        service and IVR platform and interfaces with the ICM for
        subsequent call routing, typically to a call center agent (a
        human resource tasked with answering inbound calls and
        providing services to callers).  Using the aforementioned call
        control protocols -- SIP and H.323 -- CVP interacts with all
        these devices to switch the calls to the desired destination.

        The Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) Management
        Information Base (MIB) module defines management
        instrumentation for CVP services.  Each distinct CVP service
        exposes instrumentation related to its specific function.
        The bulk of this instrumentation is run-time statistics that
        provide insight into the health, performance and capacity
        utilization of the CVP solution.  Notifications are also a
        key component of this instrumentation.  This MIB also defines
        a notification format that offers descriptive objects as well
        as objects that ease the task of correlating events at the
        management station.

        The MIB is structured such that at the highest level is a
        single generic table which enumerates the installed CVP
        services and provides a description of each as well as a
        real-time status.  The index of this table is used to relate
        the service entry to an entry in a table of additional
        instrumentation that is specific to that CVP service type.
        There are also several groups of objects that are exposed on
        each CVP server regardless of the services installed.

    DESCRIPTION
        "This syntax is used to identify the type of Customer Voice
        Portal service.  A CVP solution includes at least one, but
        probably multiple, of the following services.

        'sip':          SIP Service:  The CVP SIP service acts as an
                       active intermediary for a call, communicating
                       with both the source and destination legs of
                       the call, and providing 3rd party call control
                       capabilities on behalf of a routing engine.

        'h323':         H.323 Voice Browser Service:  The CVP H.323
                       service interacts with the CVP IVR service to
                       relay call arrival, departure and transfer
                       instructions between it and other H.323
                       devices in the network.

        'ivr':          Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Service:  The
                       CVP IVR service is responsible for creating
                       the VXML pages which implement the CVP
                       microapps based on instructions received from
                       the ICM.

        'icm':          Intelligent Contact Management (ICM) Interface
                       Service:  The CVP ICM service is responsible
                       for all communication between CVP components
                       and ICM.

        'reporting':    Reporting Service:  The CVP Reporting service
                       receives reporting events from the CVP IVR
                       service, the CVP SIP service, and the CVP
                       VoiceXML service.

        'vxml':         Voice XML Service:  The Voice XML service
                       affords standalone applications the ability
                       to forward reporting events to a CVP reporting
                       server, and to make ancillary routing requests
                       and exchange call context information with an
                       ICM, if one is present.
        'vms':         Video Media Service:  The Video Media Service
                       provides movies for agents to play to callers along
                       with the ability to pause, fast-forward and rewind
                       the video being played."

    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "This syntax is used to identify the run status of a Customer
        Voice Portal distributed service.  The value shown is the
        result of evaluating the current run status of each of the
        individual elements associated with the service.

        'disabled'          The service has not yet begun to start
                            up.

        'starting'          The service is in initialization
                            procedure, configuring and licensing, not
                            accepting connections yet.

        'inService'         The service is up and running optimally,
                            accepting connections at full QoS (if
                            applicable).

        'inServiceWarning'  The service is running sub-optimally,
                            possibly due to poor QoS or a threshold
                            reached: see transition reason for
                            explanation.

        'inServiceCritical' The service is running but very near to
                            failure, similar to 'inServiceWarning'
                            but much more dire.

        'partialService'    The service is no longer accepting new
                            calls but finishes processing active calls
                            (may be due to a loss of a dependency/
                            connectivity, or a shutdown request).

        'stopping'          The service no longer accepts new
                            connections, lets current connections
                            terminate gracefully.

        'stopped'           The service has shut down and is not
                            processing any more calls.  The process
                            itself is terminating (doing memory
                            cleanup, saving settings, shutting down
                            threads, etc.).

                            to the SNMP agent either because the link
                            between the agent and the application has
                            been broken or the agent is in the midst
                            of refreshing service status.  (A refresh
                            typically occurs after an agent restart

    DESCRIPTION
        "The SIP service table lists each Customer Voice Portal SIP
        service configured on this server.  The CVP SIP service is a
        software module which always resides in the CVP Call Server.

        The CVP SIP service is a SIP Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA).
        On the front end, it supports two SIP call legs, one incoming
        and one outgoing.  This service does not terminate RTP flows:
        it only deals with SIP messages.  On the back end, the SIP
        service implements the (GED-125) Service Control Interface
        (SCI) to the Cisco Intelligent Contact Management (ICM)
        application for call control functions only (no VRU scripts).

        The purpose of a B2BUA is to act as an active intermediary
        for a call, communicating with both the source and the
        destination legs of the call, and providing 3rd party call
        control capabilities on behalf of a routing engine (such as
        the ICM contact router).  Because it must track the call
        throughout its life, it becomes a key source of call-level
        reporting data and a natural place for moderating call
        switching resources.

        Generally speaking, a SIP B2BUA is two User Agents (UAs).
        The device receives incoming calls in one UA and immediately
        creates an outgoing call via its other UA.  Thereafter, all
        SIP messages from either one are forwarded to the other.
        What makes it useful is the fact that it puts ICM in between
        the two legs.  On incoming calls, it asks the ICM where the
        outgoing call should be addressed.  Once the call has been
        delivered, ICM has the opportunity to end the outgoing leg
        and reconnect it to a subsequent destination.  In practice,
        there will typically be a delivery to the subsequent agents
        (call center agents - a human resources tasked with answering
        inbound calls and providing specific services) or back to
        the VRU leg.

        The SIP service table has a sparse dependent relationship
        with the (generic) ccvpService table.  The service index acts
        as the primary index, relating the entry to the corresponding
        entry in the ccvpService table.

        The SNMP agent constructs this table at startup.  Since
        services can only be added or deleted when the CVP
        application is stopped, service information entries cannot be
        added to or deleted from the table either by the agent or the
        management station while the application is running.  The
        agent will update service information table objects as their
        values change when the application is running.  All objects
        in this table are read-only to the management station."

        based deployments.  Although this service started as a true,
        albeit incomplete, voice browser, its strength was its
        ability to effect complicated H.323 call control activities
        with the Gateway and the Cisco Call Manager.  Over time, the
        VXML Gateway's IOS voice browser supplanted it as a voice
        interaction device and call control became its main focus.

        SIP is still a young protocol compared to H.323 and there are
        still certain capabilities which either the gateway, the Call
        Manager or the protocol itself does not yet support.  Users
        who require these capabilities, as well as those who wish to
        upgrade without switching from H.323 to SIP will therefore
        continue to use the CVP H.323 service in place of the CVP SIP
        service.

        This table has a sparse dependent relationship with the
        Service table.  The service index acts as the primary

        The SNMP agent constructs this table at startup.  Since
        services can only be added or deleted when the CVP
        application is stopped, service information table entries
        cannot be added to or deleted from the table either by the

    DESCRIPTION
        "The IVR Service table lists each Customer Voice Portal
        Interactive Voice Response service configured on this server.
        Each entry in the table defines a separate IVR service: a
        single server is permitted to have multiple IVR services.
        The CVP IVR service is a software module which always resides
        int he CVP Call Server.

        The CVP IVR service is responsible for creating the VXML
        pages which implement the CVP Microapps based on 'Run Script'
        instructions received from the ICM. (The 'Run Script'
        instruction is part of the Service Control Interface offered
        with the GED-125 messaging protocol.)

        The service function as the VRU leg in ICM parlance and calls
        must be transferred to it from the SIP service in order to
        execute microapps.  The VXML pages created by this module are
        sent to the VXML Gateway to be executed.

        In legacy deployments only -- those which use H.323 instead
        of SIP -- the CVP IVR service can act as the switch leg as
        well.  The deployment includes a CVP H.3232 service which
        interacts with the CVP IVR service for call control
        activities.  Calls still need to be transferred to a VRU leg
        before microapps can be executed, however, in legacy
        deployments, that transferred leg may end up using the same
        CVP IVR service as the switch leg.

        The CVP IVR service plays a significant role in implementing
        CVP's native failover mechanism -- those capabilities which
        can be achieved without a Content Services Switch -- for
        Media Servers, ASR/TTS Servers and CVP VoiceXML Servers.  Up
        to two of each such server are supported and the CVP IVR
        service orchestrates retries and failover between them.

        This table has a sparse dependent relationship with the
        Service table.  The service index acts as the primary
        index, relating the entry to the corresponding entry in the
        Service table.

        The SNMP agent constructs this table at startup.  Since
        services can only be added or deleted when the CVP
        application is stopped, service information table entries

        responsible for all communication between CVP components and
        the Intelligent Contact Management (ICM) application.

        The CVP ICM service implements the GED-125 Service Control
        Interface (SCI) protocol, and sends and receives messages on
        behalf of the CVP SIP service, the CVP IVR service, and the
        CVP VoiceXML service.  Users do not explicitly install the
        CVP ICM Subsystem: it is installed and activated
        automatically in the CVP Call Server and the CVP VoiceXML
        Server.  This service is visible at the CVP Operations
        Server, however, since it does require a small amount of
        configuration.

        This table has a sparse dependent relationship with the
        Service table.  The service index acts as the primary
        index, relating the entry to the corresponding entry in the

        The SNMP agent constructs this table at startup.  Since
        services can only be added or deleted when the CVP
        application is stopped, service information table entries
        cannot be added to or deleted from the table either by the

        The CVP reporting service receives reporting events from the

        There can only be one CVP Reporting Server in a deployment.
        This does not represent a single point of failure however,

        "The Voice XML Service table lists each Customer Voice Portal
        Voice XML service installed and configured on this server.

        The CVP VXML server includes both the CVP VXML service and
        the VXML server software that executes complex IVR
        applications by exchanging VoiceXML pages with the VXML
        Gateway?s built-in voice browser.  Like almost all other CVP
        product components, it runs within a J2EE application server
        environment such as Tomcat, and many customers add their own
        custom-built or off-the-shelf J2EE components to interact
        with back-end hosts and services.  CVP VoiceXML Server
        applications are written using the CVP VoiceXML Studio, and
        deployed to the Server for execution.  They are invoked on an
        as-needed basis by a special microapp which must be executed
        from within the ICM routing script.

        The VXML Server may also be deployed in a standalone
        configuration ?- one which includes no ICM components.  In
        this model, applications are invoked as a direct result of
        calls arriving in the VXML Gateway, and a single
        post-application transfer is allowed.  Users may add the CVP
        VXML service software.  This affords standalone applications
        the additional ability to forward reporting events to a CVP
        Reporting Server, and to make ancillary routing requests and
        exchange call context information with an ICM if one is
        present.  However, the integration with ICM is nominal.

                            devastating failure has occurred: the
                            system or service is unusable.  Immediate
                            operator intervention is required.  

        'alert':            The notification indicates that a
                            devastating failure is imminent that will
                            render the system unusable.  Immediate
                            operator attention is necessary.

        'critical':         The notification indicates that a
                            service impacting failure is likely to
                            occur soon: an error has occurred that

                            system.  Operator attention is needed as
                            soon as possible.

                            operational state information and may
                            indicate that the system has experienced

                            was appropriately handled by the system.
                            An operator should review the notification
                            soon to determine if action is needed.

        'warning':          The notification contains important
                            operational state information that may be
                            a precursor to an error occurrence.  An
                            operator should review the notification
                            soon to determine if action is needed.

        'notice':           The notification contains health or
                            operational state information that may be
                            pertinent to the health of the system but
                            does not require the attention of the
                            administrator at this time.

        'informational':    The notification contains interesting
                            system-level information that is valuable
                            to an administrator, however, the event

                            impairment condition.

        'debug':            The notification provides supplemental
                            information that may be beneficial toward
                            diagnosing or resolving a problem but does
