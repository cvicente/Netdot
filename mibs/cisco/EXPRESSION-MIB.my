    DESCRIPTION
            "The MIB module for defining expressions of MIB objects
            for network management purposes.

            This MIB is an early snapshot of work done by the IETF's
            Distributed Management working group.  After this snapshot
            was taken, the MIB was modified, had new OIDs assigned,
            and then published as RFC 2982."

-- Wildcarding Example
  
-- This example refers to tables and objects defined below.  It may well
-- make more sense after reading those definitions.
  
-- An expression may use wildcarded MIB objects that result in multiple
-- values for the expression.  To specify a wildcarded MIB object a
-- management application leaves off part or all of the instance portion
-- of the object identifier, and sets expObjectWildcard to true(1) for
-- that object.  For our example we'll use a counter of total blessings
-- from a table of people.  Another table, indexed by town and person
-- has blessings just from that town.
  
-- So the index clauses are:
  
--     personEntry OBJECT-TYPE
--     ...
--     INDEX { personIndex }
  
-- And:
  
--     townPersonEntry OBJECT-TYPE
--     ...
--     INDEX { townIndex, personIndex }
  
-- In our friendly application we may have entered our expression as:
  
--     100 * townPersonBlessings.976.* / personBlessings.*
  
-- What goes in expExpression is:
  
--     100*$1/$2
  
-- For example purposes we'll use some slightly far-fetched OIDs, but
-- the weirdity won't matter.  The People MIB is 1.3.6.1.99.7 and the
-- Town MIB is 1.3.6.1.99.11, so for our two counters the OIDs are:
  
--     personBlessings	1.3.6.1.99.7.1.3.1.4
--     townPersonBlessings	1.3.6.1.99.11.1.2.1.9
  
-- The rule for wildcards is that all the wildcarded parts have to match
-- exactly.  In this case that means we have to hardwire the town and
-- only the personIndex can be wildcarded. So our values for expObjectID
-- are:
  
--     1.3.6.1.99.7.1.3.1.4
--     1.3.6.1.99.11.1.2.1.9.976
  
-- We're hardwired to townIndex 976 and personIndex is allowed to vary.
  
-- The value of expExpressionPrefix can be either of those two counter
-- OIDs (including the instance fragment in the second case), since
-- either of them takes you to a MIB definition where you can look at
-- the INDEX clause and figure out what's been left off.  What's been
-- left off doesn't have to work out to be the same object, but it
-- does have to work out to be the same values (semantics) for the
-- result to make sense. Note that the agent can not typically check
-- such semantics and if given nonsense will return nonsense.
  
-- If we have people numbered 6, 19, and 42 in town number 976, the
-- successive values of expValueInstance will be:
  
--     0.0.6
--     0.0.19
--     0.0.42
  
-- So there will be three values in expValueTable, with those OIDs as
-- the expValueInstance part of their indexing.

            "Information about a single expression.  New expressions
            can be created using expNameStatus.

            To create an expression first create the named entry in this
            table.  Then use expExpressionIndex to populate
            expExpressionTable and expObjectTable.  For expression
            evaluation to succeed all related entries in expNameTable,
            expExpressionTable, and expObjectTable must be 'active'.  If
            these conditions are not met the corresponding values in
            expValue simply are not instantiated.

            Deleting an entry deletes all related entries in
            expExpressionTable and expObjectTable.

            Because of the relationships among the multiple tables
            for an expression (expNameTable, expExpressionTable,
            expObjectTable, and expValueTable) and the SNMP rules
            for independence in setting object values, it is
            necessary to do final error checking when an expression
            is evaluated, that is, when one of its instances in
            expValueTable is read.  Earlier checking need not be
            done and an implementation may not impose any ordering
            on the creation of objects related to an expression other
            than to require values for expName and expExpressionIndex
            before any other related objects can be created.

            To maintain security of MIB information, when creating a new
            row in this table, the managed system must record the
            security credentials of the requester.  If the subsequent
            expression includes objects with expObjectSampleType
            'deltaValue' the evaluation of that expression takes place

    DESCRIPTION
            "The expression to be evaluated.  This object is the same
            as a DisplayString (RFC 1903) except for its maximum length.

            Except for the variable names the expression is in ANSI C
            syntax.  Only the subset of ANSI C operators and functions
            listed here is allowed.

            Variables are expressed as a dollar sign ('$') and an
            integer that corresponds to an expObjectIndex.  An
            example of a valid expression is:

                    ($1-$5)*100

            Expressions may not be recursive, that is although an
            expression may use the results of another expression, it
            may not contain any variable that is directly or
            indirectly a result of its own evaluation.

            The only allowed operators are:

                    ( )
                    - (unary)
                    + - * / %
                    & | ^ << >> ~
                    ! && || == != > >= < <=

            Note the parentheses are included for parenthesizing the
            expression, not for casting data types.

            The only constant types defined are:

                    int (32-bit signed)
                    long (64-bit signed)
                    unsigned int
                    unsigned long
                    hexadecimal
                    character
                    string
                    oid

            The default type for a positive integer is int unless it
            is too large in which case it is long.

            All but oid are as defined for ANSI C.  Note that a
            hexadecimal constant may end up as a scalar or an array of
            8-bit integers.  A string constant is enclosed in double
            quotes and may contain back-slashed individual characters
            as in ANSI C.

            An oid constant comprises 32-bit, unsigned integers and at
            least one period, for example:

                    0.
                    .0
                    1.3.6.1

            Integer-typed objects are treated as 32- or 64-bit, signed
            or unsigned integers, as appropriate.  The results of
            mixing them are as for ANSI C, including the type of the
            result.  Note that a 32-bit value is thus promoted to 64
            bits only in an operation with a 64-bit value.  There is
            no provision for larger values to handle overflow.

            Relative to SNMP data types, a resulting value becomes
            unsigned when calculating it uses any unsigned value,
            including a counter.  To force the final value to be of
            data type counter the expression must explicitly use the
            counter32() or counter64() function (defined below).

            OCTET STRINGS and OBJECT IDENTIFIERs are treated as 1-based
            arrays of unsigned 8-bit integers and unsigned 32-bit
            integers, respectively.

            IpAddresses are treated as 32-bit, unsigned integers in
            network byte order, that is, the hex version of 255.0.0.0 is
            0xff000000.

            Conditional expressions result in a 32-bit, unsigned integer
            of value 0 for false or 1 for true. When an arbitrary value
            is used as a boolean 0 is false and non-zero is true.

            Rules for the resulting data type from an operation, based
            on the operator:

            For << and >> the result is the same as the left hand
            operand.

            For &&, ||, ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >= the result is always
            Unsigned32.

            For unary - the result is always Integer32.

            For +, -, *, /, %, &, |, and ^ the result is promoted
            according to the following rules, in order from most to
            least preferred:

                    If left hand and right hand operands are the same
                    type, use that.

                    If either side is Counter64, use that.

                    If either side is IpAddress, use that.

                    If either side is TimeTicks, use that.

                    If either side is Counter32, use that.

                    Otherwise use Unsigned32.

            The following rules say what operators apply with what
            data types.  Any combination not explicitly defined does
            not work.

            For all operators any of the following can be the left
            hand or right hand operand: Integer32, Counter32,
            Unsigned32, Counter64.

            The operators +, -, *, /, %, <, <=, >, and >= also work with
            TimeTicks.

            The operators &, |, and ^ also work with IpAddress.

            The operators << and >> also work with IpAddress but only
            as the left hand operand.

            The + operator performs a concatenation of two OCTET STRINGs
            or two OBJECT IDENTIFIERs.

            The operators &, | perform bitwise operations on
            OCTET STRINGs.  If the OCTET STRING happens to be a
            DisplayString the results may be meaningless, but the agent
            system does not check this as some such systems do not
            have this information.

            The operators << and >> perform bitwise operations on
            OCTET STRINGs appearing as the left hand operand.

            The only functions defined are:

                    counter32
                    counter64
                    arraySection

                    sum
                    exists

            The following function definitions indicate their by naming
            the data type of the parameter in the parameter's position
            in the parameter list.  The parameter must be of the type
            indicated and generally may be a constant, a MIB object, a
            function, or an expression.

            counter32(integer) - wrapped around an integer value
            counter32 forces Counter32 as a data type.

            counter64(integer) - similar to counter32 except that the
            resulting data type is 'counter64'.

            arraySection(array, integer, integer) - selects a piece of
            an array (i.e. part of an OCTET STRING or
            OBJECT IDENTIFIER).  The integer arguments are in the
            range 0 to 4,294,967,295.  The first is an initial array
            index (1-based) and the second is an ending array index. 
            A value of 0 indicates first or last element, respectively. 
            If the first element is larger than the array length the
            result is 0 length.  If the second integer is less than or
            equal to the first, the result is 0 length.  If the second
            is larger than the array length it indicates last element.

            stringBegins/Ends/Contains(octetString, octetString) -
            looks for the second string (which can be a string constant)
            in the first and returns the 1-based index where the match
            began.  A return value of 0 indicates no match (i.e.
            boolean false).

            oidBegins/Ends/Contains(oid, oid) - looks for the second OID
            (which can be an OID constant) in the first and returns the
            the 1-based index where the match began.  A return value
            of 0 indicates no match (i.e. boolean false).

            sum(integerObject*) - sums all availiable values of the
            wildcarded integer object, resulting in an integer scalar.
            Must be used with caution as it wraps on overflow with no
            notification.

            exists(anyTypeObject) - verifies the object instance
            exists. A return value of 0 indicates NoSuchInstance
            (i.e. boolean false)."

            "Sampling interval for objects in this expression with
            expObjectSampleType 'deltaValue'.

            This object is not instantiated if not applicable.

            A value of 0 indicates no automated sampling.  In this case
            the delta is the difference from the last time the
            expression was evaluated.  Note that this is subject to
            unpredictable delta times in the face of retries or
            multiple managers.

            A value greater than zero is the number of seconds between
            automated samples.

            Until the delta interval has expired once the delta for the
            object is effectively not instantiated and evaluating
            the expression has results as if the object itself were not
            instantiated.

            Note that delta values potentially consume large amounts of
            system CPU and memory.  Delta state and processing must
            continue constantly even if the expression is not being
            used.  That is, the expression is being evaluated every
            delta interval, even if no application is reading those
            values.  For wildcarded objects this can be substantial
            overhead.

            Note that delta intervals, external expression value
            sampling intervals and delta intervals for expressions
            within other expressions can have unusual interactions as
            they are impossible to synchronize accurately.  In general
            one interval embedded below another must be enough shorter
            that the higher sample sees relatively smooth, predictable
            behavior."

            The OID may be for a leaf object (e.g. sysObjectID.0) or
