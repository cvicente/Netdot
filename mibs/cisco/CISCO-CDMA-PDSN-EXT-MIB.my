         DESCRIPTION
                 "This MIB is an extension to the 
                  CISCO-CDMA-PDSN-MIB.  A CDMA
                  network supports wireless data
                  communication through 3G CDMA radio 
                  access technology and 3G A10/A11
                  interface.  PDSN acts as a foreign  
                  agent that establishes, maintains
                  and terminates the link layer to a
                  mobile station.

                  The high level architecture of a third
                  generation CDMA network is shown below:

                  The CDMA PDSN EXTENSION MIB provides
                  operational information for a CDMA
                  PDSN implementation.
                  The following areas are managed:
														
                 1) Global PDSN information.  This area contains 
                    generic information such as the number of 
                    auxiliary connections per session, PDSN
                    IpAddress, system bandwidth etc.
									
                 2) PDSN session information.  This area contains
                    details about PPP sessions maintained by the
                    PDSN router and other related information such
                    as flows or PCF.

                 3) Failure notification.  This area contains 
                    details of notifications sent to
                    network management applications in case 
                    of session creation failure.

									                       
                 Acronyms and terms:

                 A10/A11          A10 interface is a virtual 
                 interface        interface used for
                                  transporting data between
                                  the RAN and the PDSN.
                                  A11 interface is the signaling
                                  protocol used for maintaining a
                                  logical connection between 
                                  the RAN and PDSN.
