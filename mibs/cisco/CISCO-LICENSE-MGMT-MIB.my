    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module for managing licenses on the system.
        The licensing mechanism provides flexibility to
        enforce licensing for various features in the system.

        The following text introduces different concepts and
        terms those are necessary to understand the MIB definition
        and to perform license management.

        UDI
            Universal Device Identifier that uniquely identifies a
            device. It comprises of product ID, version ID and serial
            number of the device.

        NODE LOCKED LICENSE:
            Node locked licenses are locked to one of the device
            identifiers in the system. For example, the license
            can be locked to the UDI value of one of the devices
            in the system. Locking a license to an UDI guarantees
            that the license will not be moved to a device with a
            different UDI.

        NON-NODE LOCKED LICENSE:
            Non-node locked licenses are not locked to any device
            identifier. They can be used on other similar devices.

        METERED LICENSE:
            Metered licenses are valid for limited period of time
            and they expire after that. This period is the usage
            period of a license and it is not based on real time
            clock, but system clock.

        EULA:
            End User License Agreement.

        EVALUATION LICENSE:
            Evaluation licenses are non-node locked metered
            licenses which are valid only for a limited period.
            They are used only when there are no permanent,
            extension or grace period licenses for a feature.
            User will have to accept EULA (End User License
            Agreement) before using an evaluation license. Even
            though they are not node locked, their usage is
            recorded on the device.

        EXTENSION LICENSE:
            Extension licenses are node locked metered licenses.
            These licenses are issued by Cisco's licensing portal.
            These licenses need to be installed using management
            interfaces on the device. User will have to accept an
            EULA as part of installation of extension license.

        GRACE PERIOD LICENSE:
            Grace period licenses are node locked metered licenses.
            These licenses are issued by Cisco's licensing portal
            as part of the permission ticket to rehost a license.
            These licenses are installed on the device as part of
            the rehost operation. User will have to accept an
            EULA as part of the rehost operation for this type
            of license. Details on permission ticket, rehost
            operations are provided further down in this
            description clause.

        PERMANENT LICENSE:
            Permanent licenses are node locked licenses that have
            no usage period associated with them. These licenses
            are issued by Cisco's licensing portal. These licenses
            need to be installed using management interfaces on
            the device. Once these licenses are installed, they
            will provide needed permission for the feature/image
            across different versions.

        COUNTED LICENSE:
            Counted licenses limit the number of similar entities
            that can use the license. For example, a counted
            license when used by a feature can limit the number
            of IP phones that can connect or the number of tunnels
            that can be created.

        UNCOUNTED LICENSE:
            Uncounted licenses do not limit the number of similar
            entities that can use the licenses.

        License can be enforced at the image level or at the feature
        level and this MIB module supports both.

        IMAGE LEVEL LICENSING:
            A universal image that contains all levels of
            software packages is loaded on to the device. At boot
            time, the device determines the highest level of license
            and brings up the appropriate software features or
            subsystems.

        FEATURE LEVEL LICENSING:
            Feature level licensing will support enforcement of
            license at individual feature. Features have to check
            for their licenses before enabling themselves. If it
            does not have a license, the feature should disable
            itself.

            There is a one-to-one relationship between
            a feature and a license. That is, a feature can use
            only one license at a time and a license can be used
            by only one feature at a time.

        LICENSE LINE:
            A License line is an atomic set of ASCII characters
            arranged in a particular format that holds the license
            for a single feature within it. A line has all the
            necessary fields and attributes that make it a valid,
            non-tamper able and complete license.

        LICENSE FILE:
            File generated by Cisco licensing portal. It is used
            to install license on product. It has a user readable
            part and it contains one or more license lines.

        DEVICE CREDENTIALS:
            Device credentials file is a document that is generated
            by a licensed device. This document establishes the
            identity of the device and proves that the sender/user
            has/had authorized access to the device.

        REHOST:
            Rehost operation allows a node locked license that
            is installed on a device to be installed on other
            similar device. As part of rehost operation, a device
            processes the permission ticket, revokes the license(s)
            on the device and generates a rehost ticket as the
            proof of revocation. This rehost ticket needs to be
            presented to the Cisco's licensing portal to get the
            license transferred on to a new similar device.

        PERMISSION TICKET:
            Permission ticket is a document generated by Cisco
            licensing portal that allows a device to rehost its
            licenses.

        REHOST TICKET:
            Rehost ticket is document generated by a device after
            it has applied a permission ticket. The rehost ticket
            is a proof of revocation.

        LICENSING PORTAL:
            Generates licenses, permission tickets and verifies
            device credentials and rehost tickets.

        This MIB module provides MIB objects to install, clear,
        revoke licenses. It also provides objects to regenerate
        last rehost ticket, backup all the licenses installed
        on a device, generate & export EULA for licenses.

        STEPS TO INSTALL A LICENSE:
            To install a license, the management application
            1. Retrieves device credentials of the device.
            2. Communicates with Cisco's licensing portal to get
               the license file, uses device credentials to identify
               the device
            3. Executes the license install action.

        STEPS TO CLEAR A LICENSE:
            To clear a license, the management application
            1. Identifies the license to be cleared using license
               index.
            2. Executes the license clear action.

        STEPS TO REHOST A LICENSE:
            To rehost a license, the management application
            1. Retrieves device credentials of the device.
            2. Communicates with Cisco's licensing portal to get
               the permission ticket, uses device credentials to
               identify the device.
            3. Executes the processPermissionTicket action. Device
               revokes the license and generates rehost ticket to be
               submitted as proof of revocation.
            4. Retrieves device credentials of the device where the
               license needs to be transferred to.
            5. Submits rehost ticket as proof of revocation to
               Cisco's licensing portal, uses device credentials of
               the new device to identify the device, gets license
               file.
            6. Executes the license install action on the new
               device.

        STEPS TO REGENERATE LAST REHOST TICKET:
            To regenerate last rehost ticket, the management
        application
            1. Retrieves device credentials of the device.
            2. Uses already obtained permission ticket or
               communicates with Cisco's licensing portal to get
               the permission ticket, uses device credentials to
               identify the device.
            3. Executes the regenerateLastRehostTicket action.
               Device generates rehost ticket to be submitted as
               proof of revocation.

        STEPS TO BACKUP ALL LICENSES:
            To backup all licenses installed in the device, the
            management application
            1. Specifies the backup file path.
            2. Executes the license backup action.

        STEPS TO GENERATE & EXPORT EULA:
            To install certain kind of licenses, the management
            application must accept EULA first. The management
            application can generate and export EULA for one or
            more licenses with out installing licenses as follows.
            1. Specifies the license file path that has licenses to be
               installed
            2. Specifies the EULA file path where EULA need to be
               exported to
            3. Executes the generate EULA action.

        To support the various license actions, this MIB module
        also defines MIB objects to know if a device supports
        licensing, retrieve device credentials, retrieve
        information on license stores in the device.

        It also defines MIB objects to expose management
        information associated with the licenses installed on the
        device, with the licensable features in the software image.

        This MIB module also defines various notifications that
        will be triggered to asynchronously notify the management
        application of any critical events.

        This MIB module is defined generically so it can be
        implemented on stand alone devices or stack of devices.
        In stack of devices, one device in the stack acts as
        master agent and rest are slave agents. Each device in the
        stack has its own UDI. The master agent receives requests
        on behalf of all the devices in the stack including itself
        and delegates it to other devices as needed. It also
        collects responses from other devices and sends them to
        the management application. Examples of such devices include
        stackable switches, devices with route processor and line
        cards. On the other hand, stand alone device is a single
        device and has only one UDI associated with it.

        entPhysicalIndex imported from ENTITY-MIB is used to
        identify the device uniquely. It is specified as the index
        or one of the index for tables in this MIB as needed."
    REVISION        "200811210000Z"
    DESCRIPTION

    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An entry for each action that is being executed or was
        executed recently. The management application executes an
        action
        by creating this entry. This can be done in the following
        2 methods

        1. CREATE-AND-GO method
            Management application sets clmgmtLicenseActionRowStatus to
            createAndGo(4) and all other required objects to valid
            values in a single SNMP SET request. If all the values
            are valid, the device creates the entry and executes the
            action. If the SET request fails, the entry will not be
            created.
        2. CREATE-AND-WAIT method
            Management application sets clmgmtLicenseActionRowStatus to
            createAndWait(5) to create an entry. Management application
            can set all other required objects to valid
            values in more than one SNMP SET request. If SET request
            for any of the objects fails, management application can
        set
            just only that object. Once all the required objects
            are set to valid values, management application triggers
        action
            execution by setting clmgmtLicenseActionRowStatus to
            active(1).

        To stop the action from being executed, the management
        application
        can delete the entry by setting clmgmtLicenseActionRowStatus
        to destroy(6) when clmgmtLicenseActionState is pending(2).

        The status of action execution can be known by querying
        clmgmtLicenseActionState. If the action is still in
        pending(2) or in inProgress(3) state, the management
        application need to check back again after few seconds.
        Once the action completes and status of the action is
        failed(6), the reason for failure can be retrieved
        from clmgmtLicenseActionFailCause. If the status of the
        action is partiallySuccessful(5), results of individual
        licenses can be queried from clmgmtLicenseActionResultTable.

        Not all objects in the entry are needed to execute every
        action. Below is the list of actions and the required
        objects that are needed to be set for executing that
        action.

        1. Installing a license
           The following MIB objects need to be set for installing a
           license
             a. clmgmtLicenseActionTransferProtocol

             i. clmgmtLicenseAcceptEULA
             j. clmgmtLicenseAction

           clmgmtLicenseActionEntPhysicalIndex need not be set
           explicitly for license installs. License itself identifes
           the device where the license needs to be installed.

           clmgmtLicenseStore need to be set to store the licenses
           in a non-default license store. But, if a license file
           has more than one license and licenses need to be
           installed on multiple devices (for example to multiple
           members with in a stack), then value of clmgmtLicenseStore
           is ignored and the licenses will be installed in default
           license stores of the respective devices.

        2. Clearing a license
           The following MIB objects need to be set for clearing a
           license
             a. clmgmtLicenseActionEntPhysicalIndex
             b. clmgmtLicenseActionLicenseIndex
             c. clmgmtLicenseStore
             d. clmgmtLicenseAction

        3. Revoking a license
           The following MIB objects need to be set for revoking a
           license
             a. clmgmtLicenseActionTransferProtocol
             b. clmgmtLicenseServerAddressType
             c. clmgmtLicenseServerAddress
             d. clmgmtLicenseServerUsername
             e. clmgmtLicenseServerPassword

             g. clmgmtLicenseRehostTicketFile
             h. clmgmtLicenseStopOnFailure
             i. clmgmtLicenseAction

        4. Regenerate last rehost ticket
           The following MIB objects need to be set for regenerating
           last rehost ticket
             a. clmgmtLicenseActionTransferProtocol
             b. clmgmtLicenseServerAddressType
             c. clmgmtLicenseServerAddress
             d. clmgmtLicenseServerUsername
             e. clmgmtLicenseServerPassword
             f. clmgmtLicensePermissionTicketFile
             g. clmgmtLicenseRehostTicketFile
             h. clmgmtLicenseStopOnFailure
             i. clmgmtLicenseAction


        5. Save all licenses to a backup storage
           The following MIB objects need to be set for storing all
           licenses to a backup store
             a. clmgmtLicenseActionEntPhysicalIndex
             b. clmgmtLicenseActionTransferProtocol
             c. clmgmtLicenseServerAddressType
             d. clmgmtLicenseServerAddress
             e. clmgmtLicenseServerUsername
             f. clmgmtLicenseServerPassword
             g. clmgmtLicenseBackupFile
             h. clmgmtLicenseAction

        6. Generate and export EULA if the licenses need EULA to be
           accepted for installing.
           The following MIB objects need to be set exporting required
           EULAs
             a. clmgmtLicenseActionTransferProtocol
             b. clmgmtLicenseServerAddressType
             c. clmgmtLicenseServerAddress
             d. clmgmtLicenseServerUsername
             e. clmgmtLicenseServerPassword
             f. clmgmtLicenseFile
             g. clmgmtLicenseEULAFile
             h. clmgmtLicenseAction

        For any action, if clmgmtLicenseActionTransferProtocol
        is set to local(2), the following objects need not be set.
             a. clmgmtLicenseServerAddressType
             b. clmgmtLicenseServerAddress
             c. clmgmtLicenseServerUsername
             d. clmgmtLicenseServerPassword

        Entry can be deleted except when clmgmtLicenseAction is set
        to pending(2). All entries are volatile and are cleared
        on agent reset."

    STATUS          current
    DESCRIPTION
        "An entry for each device credential export action that
        is being executed or was executed recently. The management
        application triggers the export by creating an entry in this
        table. This can be done in the following 2 methods

        1. CREATE-AND-GO method
            Management application sets clmgmtDevCredExportActionStatus
            to createAndGo(4) and all other required objects to valid
            values in a single SNMP SET request. If all the values
            are valid, the device creates the entry and executes the
            action. If the SET request fails, the entry will not be
            created.
        2. CREATE-AND-WAIT method
            Management application sets clmgmtDevCredExportActionStatus to
            createAndWait(5) to create an entry. Management application
            can set all other required objects to valid
            values in more than one SNMP SET request. If SET request
            for any of the objects fails, management application can set
            just only that object. Once all the required objects
            are set to valid values, management application triggers action
            execution by setting clmgmtDevCredExportActionStatus to
            active(1).

        To stop the action from being executed, the management application
        can delete the entry by setting clmgmtDevCredExportActionStatus
        to destroy(6) when clmgmtDevCredCommandState is pending(2).

        The status of action execution can be known by querying
        clmgmtDevCredCommandState. If the action is still in
        pending(2) or inProgress(3), the management application need to
        check back again after few seconds. Once the action completes
        and if status of the action is failed(6), the reason for
        failure can be retrieved from clmgmtDevCredCommandFailCause.

        Entry can be deleted except when clmgmtLicenseAction is set
        to inProgress(3). All entries in this table are volatile
        and are cleared on agent reset."
