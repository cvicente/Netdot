    DESCRIPTION
            "This object is used to facilitate modification of
            IGMP Filter Editor Group in the CISCO-IGMP-FILTER-MIB 
            module by multiple managers.  In particular, it is 
            useful when modifying the value of the cIgmpFilterEditor 
            object. 

            The procedure for modifying the cIgmpFilterEditor 
            object is as follows: 

                1.  Retrieve the value of cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock and 
                    of object within cIgmpFilterEditor group. 

                2.  Generate new values for 'writeable' objects
                    in the cIgmpFilterEditor group except for 
                    cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock object.

                3.  Set the value of cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock to the 
                    retrieved value, and the value of objects in 
                    cIgmpFilterEditor to the new value. If the set
                    fails for the cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock object,
                    go back to step 1. 

            The cIgmpFilterApplyStatus and cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock 
            should be read together by NMS to make sure that the 
            result is associated with its configuration request.

            To add/delete or modify a profile ( through cIgmpFilterEditor
            objects ) following procedure may be followed as an example.:

                1.  GET(cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0) and save in sValue.
                2.  SET(cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0 = sValue,
                        cIgmpFilterEditProfileIndex.0 = validProfileNumber,
                        cIgmpFilterEditStartAddress.0 = validStartAddress,
                        cIgmpFilterEditEndAddress.0 = validEndAddress,
                        cIgmpFilterEditOperation.0 =  validOperation)
                3.  If the SET in step 2 is not successful go back
                    to step 1.
                4.  If the SET in step 2 is successful, user should 
                    GET(cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0) and 
                    GET(cIgmpFilterApplyStatus.0) simultaneously.

                5.  The cIgmpFilterApplyStatus.0 reflects the outcome of
                    step 2 only if
                    cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0 = sValue + 1 or
                    cIgmpFilterEditSpinLock.0 = 0 if sValue reaches
