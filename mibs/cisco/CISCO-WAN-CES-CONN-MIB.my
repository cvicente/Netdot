    DESCRIPTION
        "The MIB module to configure the Circuit Emulation
        connections in MGX82xx series products.

        Terminology:
        CES                : Circuit Emulation Service.
                             The CES defines a method of
                             carrying a traffic from non-ATM telephony
                             devices over an ATM cloud. The CES provides
                             an interworking function(IWF) that allows
                             the two protocols to communicate.
        channel , endpoint : channel and connection endpoint 
                             have same meaning and are used 
                             interchangebly.
        DAX Connection     : Digital Access and Cross-connect connection
                             is a connection where master and slave
                             endpoints are with in the same MGX shelf.
        CAS                : Channel Associated Signaling. This
                             is in-band signaling.
        CCS                : Common Channel Signaling. This is
                             is out-of-band signaling."

                          The SRTS measures the difference between

                          the circuit in the AAL1 header.
                          The receiving end reconstructs the clock by

                          The local (interface) service clock is
