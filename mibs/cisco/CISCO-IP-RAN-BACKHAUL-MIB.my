    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB provides information on the IP-RAN traffic
        from cell site to aggreagation site in the following
        situations.  In an GSM environment the cell site will
        be the Base station Transceiver System(BTS) and the
        aggregation site will be the Base Station 
        Controller(BSC).  In the UMTS environment the cell 
        site will be the B-Node and the aggregation site will 
        Radio Network Controller(RNC).



        There are two typical type backhaul, also know 
        as longhaul, links.  The traditional backhaul 
        connection consists of a PPP multilink containing two
        or more E1 or T1 links or ATM or ATM/IMA.  The 
        alternate backhaul is traffic transported using
        IP cloud. 


        Simple back-to-back configuration
        ---------------------------------
           This setup consists of two devices that 
           support a limited number of GSM and UMTS links.
           They are deployed in pairs and inserted between
           the existing BTS device and BSC device.

        Aggregate node configuration
        ----------------------------
        This configuration consists of one aggregate node
        located at BSC site and several devices at BTS 
        sites. The aggregate device has a seperate backhaul
        link to each BTS site.

        Shorthaul interfaces support the following protocols.

        ifType.44 = atmIma(107)


        The following list provides the currently allowed
        backhaul interfaces types.  Additional interfaces
        types will be added as they are supported.

        In order to manage the IP-RAN optimization solution, two
        key factors must be monitored. The first and most 
        important is the amount of traffic sent over the backhaul
        interface.  The second is compression efficiency which has
        a direct impact amount of traffic placed backhaul link.
