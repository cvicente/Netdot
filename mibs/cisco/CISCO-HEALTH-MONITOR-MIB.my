        DESCRIPTION
                "Health Monitor MIB module.

                The Health Monitor uses a model based on events of varying 
                severity and frequency, and predefined rules, to generate 
                a metric that represents a system's (and its subsystems') 
                level of health.   

                The events are typically internally generated notifications
                in response to detrimental or correctional changes in the 
                state of the hardware or software of the system. Detrimental
                events are classified under one of the following severity 
                levels:

                Catastrophic   - Causes or leads to system failure
                Critical       - Major subsystem or functionality failure
                High           - Potential for major impact to important 
                                 functions
                Medium         - Potential for minor impact to functionality
                Low            - Negligible impact to functionality

                Whilst correctional events fall under the following 
                classification:

                Positive       - Not a fault event. May cause or lead to 
                                 the return of functionality

                This MIB module provides information for tracking occurrences
                of the above events, and presents the associated health 
                metric for the system and its component subsystems."
