    DESCRIPTION
        "This MIB reports the congestion status of the real server.
        A server can be in congested state due to high memory
        consumption, high CPU utilization or high number of clients
        being served by it. Congestion can cause delay in server
        response time.
        DFP (Dynamic Feedback Protocol) weight values are used as a
        metric to monitor the congestion of the server.

        This MIB generates notifications when congestion state
        is detected on the real server.   
        DFP weight is calculated as follows

        BindingWeight=(Maxbindings-numberOfBindings)/Maxbindings

        CPUMemWeight=(cpu + mem)/32

        Weight = BindingWeight*CPUMemWeight*dfp_max_weight

        Here,
         - Maxbindings is the maximum number of bindings allowed on the
        server.
         - dfp_max_weight is the maximum possible value of DFP weight
        (24).
         - numberOfBindings is the number of mobile bindings currently
        present with the server.

        The DFP weight at which congestion is detected is configurable.
         If the DFP weight of the system falls below this value, then
        the system is treated as congested and notification is
        generated."

        this congestion type is configured.
