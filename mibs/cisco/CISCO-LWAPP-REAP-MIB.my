        DESCRIPTION             
                "This MIB is intended to be implemented on all those
                devices operating as Central Controllers (CC) that
                terminate the Light Weight Access Point Protocol
                tunnel from Light-weight LWAPP Access Points.

                Information represented by this MIB is passed by the
                controller to those Cisco LWAPP APs, that can
                operate in stand-alone mode.  

                The relationship between CC and the LWAPP APs
                can be depicted as follows:

                The LWAPP tunnel exists between the controller and
                the APs.  The MNs communicate with the APs through
                the protocol defined by the 802.11 standard.

                LWAPP APs, upon bootup, discover and join one of the
                controllers and the controller pushes the configuration,
                that includes the WLAN parameters, to the LWAPP APs.
                The APs then encapsulate all the 802.11 frames from
                wireless clients inside LWAPP frames and forward
                the LWAPP frames to the controller.

                                   GLOSSARY

                Access Point ( AP )

                An entity that contains an 802.11 medium access
                control ( MAC ) and physical layer ( PHY ) interface
                and provides access to the distribution services via
                the wireless medium for associated clients.  

                LWAPP APs encapsulate all the 802.11 frames in
                LWAPP frames and sends them to the controller to which
                it is logically connected.

                Central Controller ( CC )

                The central entity that terminates the LWAPP protocol
                tunnel from the LWAPP APs.  Throughout this MIB,
                this entity is also referred to as 'controller'.

                Light Weight Access Point Protocol ( LWAPP ) 

                This is a generic protocol that defines the
                communication between the Access Points and the
                Central Controller.

                Mobile Node ( MN )

                A roaming 802.11 wireless device in a wireless
                network associated with an access point.

                Native VLAN ID

                A switch port and/or AP can be configured with a
                'native VLAN ID'.  Untagged or priority-tagged
                frames are implicitly associated with the native
                VLAN ID.  The default native VLAN ID is '1' if
                VLAN tagging is enabled.  The native VLAN ID is '0'
                or 'no VLAN ID' if VLAN tagging is not enabled.

                Remote Edge Access Point ( REAP )

                The LWAPP AP that can also act as a stand-alone AP
                when it loses communication with the controller
                it was associated with.

                When REAP can reach the controller (connected state),
                it gets help from controller to complete client
                authentication. When a controller is not reachable by
                REAP, it goes into standalone state and does client
                authentication by itself.  All data packets from
                clients are either bridged locally (local-switch)
                or forwarded to the controller (central-switch)
                depending on the WLAN configuration.

                Virtual LAN

                VLAN defined in the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN standard
                supports logically segmenting of LAN
                infrastructure into different subnets or
                workgroups so that packets are switched only
                between ports within the same VLAN.

                VLAN ID
                Each VLAN is identified by a 12-bit 'VLAN ID'.
                A VLAN ID of '0' is used to indicate 'no VLAN ID'.
                Valid VLAN IDs range from '1' to '4095'.

                LWAPP APs operating in REAP mode locally switch 
                the data frames of the associated clients, rather 
                than tunneling them through to the LWAPP controller 
                as LWAPP data packets.  The LWAPP controller
                passes this configuration set to the LWAPP AP during
                the AP initialization so that the AP can operate
                in stand-alone mode when it fails to reach the
                controller.  The configuration is also passed to
                the REAP when they are individually modified through
                separate LWAPP messages.  The REAP updates itself
                with the information received through these LWAPP
