# A general note about these Netdot variables: Some are accessed when
# a user requests a page and others are accessed when a user attempts
# to login.  In our setup the login target (NetdotLogin) is in the
# same apache scope as the netdot pages (/netdot) and these variables
# are specified at the global scope so there isn't an issue, but if
# you decide to move them inside a Directory, Files, or Location block
# and move the login target be sure that you put the right variables
# in the right places (hint: you will probably have to read the
# AuthCookie code as it is not clear from the docs, if you don't want
# any duplicates).  The same probably goes for the SiteControl and
# other non prefixed variables, but since they don't have prefixes it
# would be inconsiderate to put them at the top level (pollute the
# global name space), and so if you move the login target be sure to
# duplicate any relevant variables (again, it might not be obvious
# which).
