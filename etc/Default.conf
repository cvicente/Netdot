# Netdot tries to automate the assignment of DNS names for each

# delegate the logic to a "Plugin" class, which allows users
# to write their own behavior.  We provide three plugins:
#
# 1) DeviceIpNamesFixed: Assigns the main device name to all IPs
# 2) DeviceIpNamesByInt: Assigns names derived from the Interface
#    names. e.g. fe-1-0-0.device.localdomain.  Useful in traceroutes.
# 3) DeviceIpNamesFromDNS: Names are assigned by resolving the IP through DNS.
